USS Callister,"

""USS Callister"" is the first episode of the fourth series of the anthology series Black Mirror. Written by series creator Charlie Brooker and William Bridges and directed by Toby Haynes, it first aired on Netflix, along with the rest of series four, on 29 December 2017.

The episode follows Robert Daly (Jesse Plemons), a reclusive but gifted programmer and co-founder of a popular massively multiplayer online game who is bitter over the lack of recognition of his position from his coworkers. He takes out his frustrations by simulating a Star Trek–like space adventure within the game, using his co-workers' DNA to create sentient digital clones of them. Acting as the captain of the USS Callister starship, Daly is able to order his co-workers around, bend them to his will, and mistreat them if they get out of line. When Daly brings newly hired Nanette Cole (Cristin Milioti) into his game, she encourages the other clones to revolt against Daly.

In contrast to most Black Mirror episodes, ""USS Callister"" contains overt comedy, and it has many special effects. As a fan of Star Trek, Bridges was keen to introduce many details from the show into ""USS Callister"", though the episode was conceived mostly with The Twilight Zone episode ""It's a Good Life"" and Viz character Playtime Fontayne in mind. The episode's reception was overwhelmingly positive, with reviewers praising the allusions to Star Trek, the acting, and the cinematography. Critics saw the episode as being about male abuse of authority, and compared Daly to contemporary events surrounding internet bullies and sexual abuse committed by Harvey Weinstein. In 2018, the episode won four Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Television Movie and Outstanding Writing for a Limited Series, Movie, or Dramatic Special, and was nominated for three other Emmy Awards.

Aboard the spaceship USS Callister, Captain Robert Daly (Jesse Plemons) and his crew destroy their arch enemy Valdack's (Billy Magnussen) ship, but he escapes. The crew celebrates, with Daly kissing both female crewmates.

The real-life version of Daly is CTO at Callister Inc. The company was co-founded by Daly and James Walton (Jimmi Simpson), the company's CEO, which produces the multiplayer game Infinity, in which users control a starship in a simulated reality. Daly is treated poorly by his fellow employees, who appear identical to Captain Daly's crewmates. New programmer Nanette Cole (Cristin Milioti) praises Daly's work on Infinity, but the more assertive Walton interrupts to show her around the office. When Daly returns home, he opens a development build of Infinity which is modded to resemble his favourite television show Space Fleet. As Captain Daly, he berates the crewmates, strangling a subservient Walton.

After employee Shania Lowry (Michaela Coel) warns Nanette to beware of Daly, he takes a discarded coffee cup of Nanette's and uses her DNA to replicate her consciousness within his development build. Nanette awakens aboard the USS Callister, confused and distraught. Lowry explains that they are digital clones of Callister Inc. staff members. Nanette attempts to escape the ship but is teleported back to the bridge. She refuses to obey Daly's commands, so he removes her facial features, suffocating her, until she relents.

The crew embark on a mission in which they apprehend Valdack but spare his life. After Daly leaves, Nanette finds a way to send a game invitation containing a message for help to the real-world Nanette. The real-world Nanette asks the real-world Daly about the message, and he dismisses it as spam. Daly enters the game to interrogate his crew and transforms Lowry into a monster when she defends Nanette. Once Daly departs, Nanette identifies a distant wormhole as an uplink to Infinity's next update; she surmises that by flying into the wormhole, the firewall will delete them and they will die. Walton is very hesitant to help; he explains that Daly has previously recreated his son Tommy within the game, throwing him out of an airlock to punish Walton. He also points out that since Daly still has all their DNA, he can just recreate them and punish them further. Nanette promises the crew that they will recover the lollipop containing Tommy's DNA.

When Daly returns, Nanette convinces him to take her on a mission to Skillane IV alone. She strips to her underwear and runs into nearby water; Daly reluctantly swims with her, leaving behind the omnicorder which allows him to control the game. The crew teleports the omnicorder onto their ship, and uses it to access sexually explicit images of Nanette on her PhotoCloud account. They use those photos to blackmail the real-life Nanette into ordering a pizza to Daly's apartment and stealing the DNA samples while he answers the door. The cloned crew then teleport digital Nanette onto the ship.

As Daly resumes play, he discovers the crew are escaping. He commandeers a crashed spaceship to pursue them through an asteroid belt. The Callister collides with an asteroid; Walton repairs the thrusters manually, incinerating himself, and the ship accelerates into the wormhole. The firewall detects Daly's modded build and locks his controls, rendering him physically unable to exit the game as it is deleted around him. In the real world, Daly is sitting motionless.

The crew reawakens in the un-modded version of Infinity with Valdack and Lowry, restored to human form. Now free, they continue their adventure, with Nanette leading them, after interacting with an annoyed user, ""Gamer691"" (Aaron Paul).

Whilst series one and two of Black Mirror were shown on Channel 4 in the UK, Netflix commissioned the series for 12 episodes (split into two series of six episodes) in September 2015 with a bid of $40 million,[1][2] and in March 2016, Netflix outbid Channel 4 for the right to distribute the series in the UK.[2] The six episodes in series four were released on Netflix simultaneously on 29 December 2017.[3] ""USS Callister"" is listed as the first episode, though as each episode is standalone the episodes can be watched in any order.[4] The episode has a running time of 76 minutes.

Sometimes ideas come about where we say, ""What haven't we done yet,"" and we said, ""We haven't done space, and what's a 'Black Mirror' version of a space epic?""

Charlie Brooker, interview with Variety[5]

The episode was written in November 2016[6] by series creator Charlie Brooker along with William Bridges, who previously co-wrote series 3 episode ""Shut Up and Dance"".[3] Brooker said that the episode was based around doing ""a 'Black Mirror' version of a space epic"",[5] an idea that began during the filming of series three episode ""Playtest"".[7] Inspired partially by ""It's a Good Life"",[6] an episode of The Twilight Zone about a boy with ""God-like powers"", and partially by Viz character Playtime Fontayne, an adult who makes people participate in childish games, Charlie Brooker compares Daly to dictator Kim Jong-un and to ""someone going online and venting"".[8] Brooker said that they also at times called the episode an ""adult Toy Story"", making the comparison between the toys in Andy's room having to hold still until Andy leaves, and the virtual crew having to hold back their true thoughts until Daly left the simulation.[9] Though sometimes very bleak, the episode has comedy that may be considered atypical for the show,[3] and Brooker thinks it is the most mainstream episode of the show.[8] Additionally, Brooker compares it to series 3 episode ""San Junipero"" in that both were ""a conscious decision to expand what the show was and then upend it.""[3]

As a big fan of Star Trek, Bridges suggested many elements from it that are incorporated in the episode, as well as borrowed concepts from the film Galaxy Quest, which involved normal people suddenly pulled into an inescapable science fiction setting.[10] Brooker tells Den of Geek that the episode is not intended as an attack on Star Trek, a show that was ""wildly ahead of its time"".[7] Originally, Daly's character was more unlikeable from the episode's beginning, but this was changed so that Daly strangling Walton would be more of a surprise. Brooker states that Daly dies of starvation after the events in the episode, due to the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign he puts on his door.[8] Haynes considered ending the episode with the shot of Daly in his apartment, rather than the happier scene of the crew playing Infinity, but Brooker reassured him that not every Black Mirror episode had to end unhappily.[11]

In the episode's initial draft, every character had a ""Grain"" implanted in them—a device that recorded their vision and hearing, similar to what was featured in the series one episode ""The Entire History of You"". This explained why virtual Nanette had the memories of real-life Nanette. Brooker decided that showing the Grain contents alongside Daly getting each person's DNA was too much detail, which led to the Grain aspect being cut. Shania says ""It's a fucking gizmo"" in response to a question from Nanette about how Daly's technology works, as a way to comment that the technology not making sense did not matter.[10]

""USS Callister"" stars Jesse Plemons as Captain Daly and Cristin Milioti as Lieutenant Cole, both previous stars of Fargo. Director Toby Haynes notes that ""they always wanted Jesse Plemons for the role of Daly"", and that the filming dates and other cast were based around him.[12] Milioti accepted the role having only seen a few pages of the script; she said in an interview that Nanette is ""a woman in charge [fighting] against a small-minded, misogynist bully"".[11] Jimmi Simpson, formerly known from Westworld, and Michaela Coel of Chewing Gum are also main characters in the episode; Coel had appeared in the previous Black Mirror episode ""Nosedive"" as an airport worker.[13][14][15] Simpson was ill with the flu during filming but noted that his character was intended to be skinny.[16] The episode's main cast is rounded out by Billy Magnussen, Milanka Brooks, Osy Ikhile, and Paul G. Raymond.[17]

Aaron Paul makes a vocal cameo appearance at the end of the episode, whilst Plemons' fiancée Kirsten Dunst makes an uncredited appearance in the office background early on, after asking the director while on set.[18][19] The director had to ask for the single shot she was in to be re-added after the continuity department edited it out.[19] Paul's character ""Gamer691"" was initially supposed to be a ""geeky kid"", but Brooker believed that the perception of video gamers as creepy was wrong, and ""he felt like it was talking down to the audience"" as he is a gamer himself.[20] He then came up with the idea that the best voice would be Paul's character Jesse Pinkman from Breaking Bad, a show that featured Plemons in the role of Todd Alquist.[21]

The production approached Paul, who was a fan of Black Mirror and had already auditioned for a different episode but withdrew due to commitments with Welcome Home.[21] Paul accepted the part on the condition that his appearance in this episode did not preclude him from being part of another Black Mirror episode.[19][20] He later starred in the space-themed series six episode ""Beyond the Sea"".[22] The part was one of the last elements of the episode to be finished, and it surprised members of the cast when it was screened.[20]

Director Toby Haynes has previously worked on Sherlock and Doctor Who,[13] and crew from Stars Wars and 2014 film Guardians of the Galaxy were hired.[10] Filming began in January 2017[6] and ran for twenty days.[12] The episode was mostly shot in the U.K., with roughly three days of filming in the Canary Islands for interplanetary scenes.[12][23] The scenes set on the Callister ship, Daly's apartment, and the Callister offices were shot at Twickenham Studios, with all of the office scenes shot within three days.[20] Most scenes had to be done in two or three takes, with some scenes such as Walton's description of Tommy being filmed in one take.[12] Haynes and Milioti both commented on the tight schedule, with Haynes feeling that the pressure helped everyone to rise to the challenge.[20] Brooker notes that the growth of the Me Too movement meant the episode felt more timely.[9]

The crew could not copy set elements directly from Star Trek without fear of legal action, but instead detailed the set in the same fashion as Star Trek or Battlestar Galactica. The episode also presents Space Fleet following a similar history as Star Trek, first as a 4:3 aspect ratio to represent its original broadcast format of the original series, then to detailed widescreen version, and finally ending on a redesigned starship and costumes that reflect the J. J. Abrams-helmed reboot.[24] Inspired by the style of 1960s television, the episode used Dutch angles during the spaceship scenes. Cinematography towards the end was designed to evoke Star Trek.[25] Haynes was a fan of Star Trek, and helped to add details, such as putting Lowry in a red uniform since she was the first to be killed off. A number of Star Wars references are also included.[12]

The spaceship initially uses orange and red colours, and the special effects were made to look like those from the 1960s; a modern version of the ship is shown at the end of the episode, more similar to the 2009 Star Trek reboot.[10] To help the viewer distinguish between scenes set in the game and those set in the real world, Haynes had the scenes set in the game use mounted camera shots, while the real-world scenes used handheld camera techniques; in the scene where Daly interrupts the game to get a delivered pizza, the camera started off mounted and then switched to handheld to show the collision of those two techniques.[12] Characters aboard the USS Callister wore neoprene costumes, designed to create an artificial Barbie look for the women. Daly looks like a Ken doll, with his costume making him appear more muscular. Milioti aimed to change her posture and mannerisms slightly between Nanette in the real world and the virtual world. Plemons watched Star Trek and worked with a vocal coach to pay homage to William Shatner's performance as Captain Kirk.[10]

To avoid building an entire spaceship, most scenes on board the ship were set on the bridge or in corridors; a canteen area was considered but not used.[10] The scene where Cole wakes up on the ship was initially going to use a medical bay, but Haynes wanted to use a circular room. The storyboard design for Lowry being turned into a monster had to be adapted during filming so the viewers could see her sprouting extra legs and tentacles. For the two planets visited in the episode, the script described one as an Indiana Jones–style cave and the other as a jungle planet, but budget limitations and the filming date of February affected the choices made. The scene in which Nanette tricks Daly into swimming with her was filmed at a crater-like structure in Lanzarote, using red sand from a nearby quarry, and at a lake with black sand. A drone was used to film an aerial shot of the set.[25] Both actors improvised much of the scene.[10] Production companies Painting Practice and Revolver worked on graphics and the user interfaces in the spaceship,[10] whilst special effects were done by Framestore.[26] Brooker says the episode features more special effects than any previous episode of the show.[7] The Arachnajax monsters were designed to be a mixture of scary and comedic, with features like their ability to shrug making them more human-like.[10]

British composer Daniel Pemberton composed the episode's score. A fan of Black Mirror, Pemberton had worked with Brooker before on a video game magazine in the 1990s.[27] Pemberton was between compositions for Molly's Game and All the Money in the World, but despite being busy he accepted the job for ""USS Callister"".[28] Pemberton says the score consisted of three styles: the Space Fleet music, the real world and Daly's video game.[29] He also describes the soundtrack as ""almost like two film scores that slowly collide"".[27] Pemberton wrote a score with elements reminiscent of Star Trek, and other ""synthetic and modern"" aspects,[29] and some of the music was inspired by Jerry Goldsmith.[27] A 70-piece orchestra from Prague was used.[29] The soundtrack was released on Amazon Music on 29 December 2017.[30] A vinyl version of the soundtrack, featuring as its cover the Butcher Billy-designed Space Fleet poster seen on the episode, was released on Record Store Day 2019.[31]

In May 2017, a Reddit post unofficially announced the names and directors of the six episodes in series 4 of Black Mirror.[32] The first trailer for the series was released by Netflix on 25 August 2017, and contained the six episode titles.[33][34] In September 2017, two photos from the fourth season were released, including one from ""USS Callister"".[35]

Beginning on 24 November 2017, Netflix published a series of posters and trailers for the fourth series of the show, referred to as the ""13 Days of Black Mirror"".[13] The art for ""USS Callister"" was released on 4 December, and the trailer on 5 December.[36] The following day, Netflix published a trailer featuring an amalgamation of scenes from the fourth series, which announced that the series would be released on 29 December.[37]

Prior to the series' release, ""USS Callister"" was described as the ""most anticipated new episode"" by one source;[15] it was compared by Charlie Brooker to ""San Junipero"", the most successful episode of the previous series.[38] ""USS Callister"" was considered to be one of the few Black Mirror episodes that could have a sequel, given the final scene; both Brooker and Jones agreed that if they ever opted to a sequel, it would likely be based on this episode as ""they end up in a universe of infinite possibilities, and there's a lot of question marks we've left hanging"".[9]

The episode is an homage to Star Trek.[39][40] Using a similar set design to Star Trek,[39] the episode has been compared to another parody of the show, the 1999 film Galaxy Quest.[39][41] One reviewer described ""USS Callister"" as critical of sexism in Star Trek and its fandom,[42] with another calling it ""a cruel parody and even a misandrous attack"",[43] though Brooker says that ""I don't want it to be seen that we're attacking fans of classic sci-fi"".[7] It has a similar storyline to short story ""I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream"", which features characters held hostage and tortured by a supercomputer.[42] Additionally, it evokes Toy Story.[44] The procedurally-generated game Infinity in the episode is considered to be inspired by No Man's Sky, a video game released in August 2016.[45] Brooker commented in October 2016 that ""there's an idea for the second [Netflix] season that's sprung from a procedurally generated universe"" while playing the game.[46]

""USS Callister"" has been called ""the most cinematic episode to date"" for the show,[40] due to its use of vivid colours and a huge fictional landscape.[44][47] Though the episode is dark at times and raises serious issues, it also has a perkier tone to previous Black Mirror episodes,[39] containing one-line jokes and visual gags,[41] and a happy ending relative to other episodes of the show.[41] Its plot twist is revealed slowly, a contrast to the ""gut-punch"" reveal of previous episodes.[47]

Main character Robert Daly has an unhappy life, where he does not receive credit for co-founding his company and is mocked by workplace colleagues.[40] Traditionally, Daly would be the underdog character, and the story might focus on him getting revenge on Walton for stealing his credit, and for his colleagues' mistreatment of him.[16] The classic plotline of a socially awkward man meeting a younger woman who appreciates his intelligence is utilised when Daly meets Cole.[39] As a result, viewers initially side with Daly, but instead of the pair falling in love, Daly's true nature is unmasked early.[39] As the Captain of USS Callister, he abuses his position of power, forcing his crewmates to act as opposites of themselves, such as Walton going from Daly's superior to his underling.[48] Similar to an internet bully, Daly does not seem to care about the pain he is inflicting on the virtual clones,[41] treating them as action figures.[48]

Critic Alec Bojalad stated that Daly fits an archetype of white males who participate in prejudiced online echo chambers due to social ostracisation in real life and a sense of entitlement.[44] Charles Bramesco considered Daly characteristic of the nerd who assumes the role of the bully after himself being bullied.[48] Dana Schwartz linked this to the ""modern toxic masculinity"" movements of Gamergate and the alt-right.[16] Likewise, Sonia Saraiya of Vanity Fair called Daly an ""incel king"" exhibiting ""a tired, stubborn form of masculinity clinging to control"" with an entitlement to women compared to Cole's feminist fight for her own autonomy.[49]

Charles Bramesco of Vulture noted that despite the fact that Daly never actually rapes any of the female members of the crew, he exhibits psychological traits associated with rape culture.[48] Tristram Fane Saunders of The Telegraph called the episode ""a sharp attack on an entire genre of male-driven narrative"" and equates Daly's sexist fantasy involving his attractive younger co-worker with the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations.[39] Sara Moniuszko of USA Today made the same comparison, linking how Daly kisses female crew members and threatens the crew when they disobey him to Weinstein's alleged abuse.[50] Brooker noted that coincidentally, news of allegations against Weinstein first broke when Brooker was on his way to a premiere of the episode in New York.[9] Female crew members are dressed in sexualised outfits in Daly's game, but wear more modern outfits when they escape.[51]

Joho called Walton ""arguably the true hero of the story"", for sacrificing himself to fix the ship at the climax of the episode.[52] However, Jimmi Simpson—who played Walton—disagreed, noting that his character's thoughtlessness and selfishness were the original provocation for Daly to take revenge. Simpson opined that Walton's motive for sacrificing himself is not redemption but to ""make it right for the people"".[16] Walton is absent from the ship once the characters make it into the online Infinity game; it can be interpreted that his code was deleted from Daly's modded game.[52] However, Simpson believed that his character remains alive, continually tortured from the pain of the incinerators.[52][16]

""USS Callister"" features references to previous episodes of Black Mirror. In addition to Brooker's remark that the episode is in some ways a successor to the third-series episode ""San Junipero,""[3] the neural implant used in this episode to transport users into the Infinity game bears the logo ""TCKR"", the company that developed the technology featured in that episode, the implication being that Callister uses the same software for their own games.[24] A reference to the second-series episode ""White Bear"" is found in the names of two planets visited by the crew of Daly's virtual spaceship; the planets Skillane IV and Rannoch have been named for the criminal couple of Victoria Skillane and Iain Rannoch.[53]

""USS Callister"" was described by several critics as the best episode of series four.[44][48][54][55] On Rotten Tomatoes, 95% of 38 reviews are positive, with an average rating of 9.3 out of 10.[56] It received a four-star rating in The Telegraph[39] and Den of Geek,[44] an A rating in IndieWire,[54] and an A− rating in The A.V. Club.[57] Cross called the episode ""surely one of Black Mirror's best"".[58] Saunders thought that the male abuse of power is ""prescient"" and ""topical"",[39] while Bojalad wrote that the episode's timing is ""just right"".[44] However, Dileo criticised the episode as ""possibly not the deepest or most insightful"" of the programme,[23] and Oller wrote that the episode's ""mixed metaphors"" cause positive aspects to be ""drowned out"".[59]

The episode's parody of Star Trek has been widely praised,[48][41] with Statt calling it an ""unabashed love letter to Star Trek"",[45] while Franich described it as a ""knowing parody"" and ""loving hyperbolization"".[55] Cross believes it has a ""love for the source material"".[58] Statt also praised the episode's references to other media such as No Man's Sky.[45] However, it has also received criticism. Lambie wrote that allusions to Star Trek ""aren't all that new"",[41] while Saunders believed that the numerous references ""clobber you over the head"".[39] Oller called them ""heavy-handed"", believing they overshadow the episode's message.[59] In a negative review, Whitley opined that although the episode has the right number of references, they are used in a ""cruel parody and even a misandrous attack on male science-fiction fans"".[43]

""USS Callister"" is more comedic than previous episodes of Black Mirror and explores a genre which is new for the show, both of which were well-received.[23] Statt described it as ""laugh-out-loud funny"";[45] Sims called it ""darkly funny"";[60] and, in a negative review, Oller wrote that the ""comedy is far better than the actual story"".[59] Stolworthy calls the genre change ""heaps of fun"",[40] while Statt called it ""refreshingly different"".[45] Starkey described the episode as proof that the show has room to grow.[47]

The ending and DNA cloning technology have both been highlighted by critics, garnering mixed reception. Saunders said the episode's ending ""might not feel very Black Mirror"" but is ""the kind of story it would be good to hear more often"".[39] Starkey described the ending as ""wonderfully bleak"",[47] while Sims praised the happy ending.[60] However, Handlen called it ""sudden"" and ""rushed"", believing that the episode is ""a little too eager to please"", which causes it to lose tension.[57] Oller lambasted the episode for numerous plot holes and its ""sprawling sci-fi rules and nonsense"" such as the DNA cloning plot device.[59] VanDerWerff similarly criticised the cloning technology's lack of explanation;[61] Handlen called it ""magic that you either go with or you don't"".[57]

Other parts of the plot have also received mixed reception. Starkey believed the ""early plot jumps"" are ""slightly heavy-handed"".[47] Sims praised the twist which reveals that Daly is not the protagonist.[60] Lambie opined that the flashback with Walton's son adds a ""chill running through the middle of the episode"",[41] but VanDerWerff criticised that it unnecessarily adds length to the episode.[61] VanDerWerff compared the crew's escape plan favourably to a ""movie prison break"",[61] though Franich believed that the fast pace causes the ""dull"" blackmail of Nanette to be ""a too-easy gag"".[55] Stolworthy said the length of the episode is justified,[40] though Starkey wrote that the episode ""occasionally meanders"",[47] and Sims concurred that the episode is ""a mite too long"".[60]

The cast of the episode have been widely praised.[23][59] Saunders wrote that Plemons is ""obviously perfect"" as Daly,[44] and he was praised by Lambie, Miller and Franich for his acting of Daly's two different personalities.[41][54][55] VanDerWerff wrote that Plemons ""blends a surprisingly great William Shatner riff with a slow-building sense of odiousness"".[61] Miller called the character ""truly grounded in reality"" due to the writing and acting.[54] Simpson's performance as Walton is singled out by Stolworthy and Bojalad for praise,[40][44] with Starkey describing him as the episode's ""emotional centerpiece"".[47] Bojalad called Milioti's character Cole the ""real revelation"" of the episode,[44] while Cross stated that she was ""painfully easy"" to relate to.[58] Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly called for Milioti to receive an Emmy nomination for Best Actress for her performance as Cole in the episode.[62] Stolworthy wrote that Coel's performance as Lowry stands out.[40] However, VanDerWerff criticised that the episode's minor characters are ""mostly quick sketches"".[61]

""USS Callister"" has been described as the show's ""most cinematic episode to date"",[40] and the episode with ""by far the highest production values"".[23] Bojalad praised the ""bright, beautiful pastel color"",[44] while Dileo noted the ""jaw-dropping special effects"".[23] Statt called the episode ""visually stunning"", concluding it is ""the first episode of Black Mirror that feels like it belongs in a movie theater"".[45] Franich wrote that the cinematography ""captures the effect"" of the original Star Trek.[55]

""USS Callister"" is mostly in the top half on critics' lists of the 19 episodes of Black Mirror by quality:



Proma Khosla of Mashable reviewed each of the 22 episodes by tone, ranking ""USS Callister"" as 5th least pessimistic.[72]

Other critics compared the six episodes of series four in isolation, with ""USS Callister"" placing as follows:



""USS Callister"" was nominated for several awards in 2018:
"
Arkangel,"

""Arkangel"" is the second episode of the fourth series of the British science fiction anthology series Black Mirror. Written by series creator and showrunner Charlie Brooker and directed by Jodie Foster, it premiered on Netflix on 29 December 2017, along with the rest of series four. In the episode, the single mother Marie (Rosemarie DeWitt) enrols her daughter Sara in a trial of Arkangel, an implanted technology which allows Marie to track Sara's location, current vision and hearing, and automatically censors distressing material.

The main theme of the episode is helicopter parenting; as a woman raised by a single mother, Foster had many views which influenced the script, such as a more complex characterisation of Marie, and was given control of casting. For the filming in November 2016, Foster chose a location in Canada to represent working-class America. Differently-aged versions of Sara are played by different actors, with Brenna Harding playing her as a teenager. 

Critics saw Marie as a parent afflicted with much anxiety and guilt and compared Arkangel to existing technologies for child monitoring, such as microchip implants and smartwatches. They were mostly laudatory of Foster's directing style and DeWitt's acting but less complimentary of the storyline and moral, which were seen as simplistic, with many reviewers suggesting themes the episode could have explored in more detail. In one scene, a nurse incorrectly implies that an emergency contraception (EC) pill induces abortion, rather than preventing pregnancy. The episode was poorly received in comparison to other Black Mirror episodes.

Single mother Marie Sambrell (Rosemarie DeWitt) gives birth to her daughter Sara and raises her with help from her father, Russ (Nicholas Campbell). Three-year-old Sara (Aniya Hodge) gets lost following a cat and a distressed Marie has to enlist help from neighbours to locate her. Afterwards, Marie signs her up for a trial of Arkangel, a child monitoring system installed via an implant. Marie can monitor Sara's vision and hearing with a tablet computer, along with viewing live medical data and past audiovisual feeds. A filter can censor stimuli when they cause Sara stress, such as an intimidating neighbourhood dog. Shortly after, Russ survives a stroke, because Marie is notified when Sara, observing Russ, experiences stress.

Six years later, Russ has died. A classmate—Trick (Nicky Torchia)—tries to show Sara (Sarah Abbott) sexual and violent imagery but the filter blurs it. Sara draws blood from her finger, trying to learn what it looks like, so Marie has her assessed by a psychologist who recommends that she dispose of Arkangel, which is soon to be banned. Marie deactivates the filter and stores the tablet in the attic. An anxious Sara goes to school unsupervised and Trick shows her pornography and gore videos.

Aged fifteen, Sara (Brenna Harding) lies to her mother about going to a friend's house to attend a party with Trick (Owen Teague). Marie discovers the lie and after failing to contact her, turns on Arkangel. She sees Sara having sex for the first time, with Trick. Marie starts to use the tablet again and soon sees Sara snorting cocaine that Trick—who deals drugs—gives her.

Identifying Trick with a reverse image search, Marie confronts him at work and blackmails him to stay away from Sara. After receiving an Arkangel notification that Sara is pregnant, Marie sneaks an emergency contraceptive pill into Sara's smoothie. She later vomits and is told by a nurse that the pill caused it. Sara confronts Marie and forces the tablet away from her. The stress filter is accidentally reactivated. Unable to see the damage she is causing, Sara beats Marie unconscious with the tablet, breaking it.

The filter deactivates and Sara runs away. When Marie regains consciousness, she frantically yells for Sara down the street. A hitch-hiking Sara gets into a truck.

Whilst series one and two of Black Mirror were shown on Channel 4 in the UK, in September 2015 Netflix commissioned the series for 12 episodes,[1] and in March 2016 it outbid Channel 4 for the rights to distribute the series in the UK, with a bid of $40 million.[2] The 12-episode order was divided into two series of six episodes each, with ""Arkangel"" in the latter group. The six episodes in series four were released on Netflix simultaneously on 29 December 2017.[3] ""Arkangel"" is listed as the second episode, but as Black Mirror is an anthology series, each instalment can be watched in any order.[4]

The episode was written by series creator Charlie Brooker. Executive producer Annabel Jones said that it was inspired by microchip implants used to identify pets that, at the time of writing, were also being considered for children. Jones said, ""We wanted to think what the updated version of that [was] and find a really good idea of how that could go terribly wrong"".[5] The episode is intended to be sympathetic to helicopter parenting; Brooker took inspiration in how protective he felt following the birth of his children.[6][7] Prior to having children, Brooker thought negatively of content restrictions designed for children, but he was concerned by his three-year-old son seeing a horror movie trailer after he left him alone with YouTube on autoplay. He was also concerned by thoughts of his children seeing an accident or hearing profanity in their day-to-day life.[8]

The actor, director and producer Jodie Foster directed Black Mirror; previous credits included episodes of the Netflix series Orange Is the New Black and House of Cards.[7] Foster was introduced to Black Mirror by Netflix's vice president of original content after telling her that she enjoyed directing short but complete stories, in contrast to serialised television programmes.[9] Brooker saw Foster as suited to ""Arkangel"" because as a former child actor, she would understand what it was like to grow up in the spotlight.[7][10] Foster was raised by a single mother, and said that the script brought up ""so many questions about who we are as women at this particular time in history"".[8] She was the first woman to direct a Black Mirror episode.[11]

Foster was in control of casting the episode and also hiring much of the production crew.[9] She cast her friend Rosemarie DeWitt as Marie. The pair had met through Foster's wife Alexandra Hedison; this was only the second time Foster had directed a friend, after Mel Gibson in the 2011 film The Beaver.[11] The Australian actor Brenna Harding was cast as Sara, after misinterpreting part of the audition tape instructions and performing a two-minute monologue in the character of Sara, rather than as herself. The three other children cast as younger versions of Sara had to be chosen to look very similar to Harding.[8] Foster was experienced in directing child actors and said that much of the skill lay in casting.[9] Owen Teague's role as Trick influenced the character: though written as a character to be distrusted, Foster said that Teague has ""sweetness"" and Harding described Trick and Sara as ""like two old souls who connected"".[8]

The original script gave Marie's father only a very minor part, but this was fleshed out by Foster. She also influenced other changes in the script, and offered many observations on the technology used and Marie's motivation for her actions after seeing her daughter have sex with Trick.[6][8] In contrast to Jones and Brooker's more positive conception of Marie, Foster was informed by her life experience to show a darkness to her character.[9] Explaining the actions of her character Marie, DeWitt said that single mothers ""experience betrayal differently"". Foster added that when Marie realises Sara is lying to her but does not confront her, it causes a ""fissure"" and Marie begins ""fighting a battle to win control"". By attempting to prevent her daughter from leaving her, Marie is victim to a self-fulfilling prophecy as she ""engendered the exact result that she most feared"".[12]

The episode was filmed across three weeks in November 2016.[13] A location in Hamilton, Ontario, was chosen by Foster to depict blue-collar America.[9] Jones was present for filming but Brooker was not.[9] Foster described the fictional setting as a ""place that used to have a foundation and a glory"", which reflects how Marie views herself.[8] She stated that the filming involved ""very long hours"" and that the scenes starring the younger children were particularly troublesome.[11] Graphic content was mostly avoided in the episode, with Foster believing it would ""distract from what the meaning was"". An exception was the scene where Sara attacks her mother.[12] Brooker noted that in this scene, more hits were filmed than made it into the episode, though enough were needed in the final cut for the viewer to understand Sara's perspective, and for Marie to be plausibly rendered unconscious.[6] The final shot of the episode, where Marie frantically tries to use the tablet shouting ""No!"" repeatedly, was filmed the day after the presidential election results were known and Donald Trump became president-elect; DeWitt injected her personal reaction at the results into the scene.[13]

Foster described the ending as a ""parable"".[8] DeWitt's first day on set was to film the scene where a bloodied Marie runs out of the house screaming for her daughter. The episode ends with Sara entering a truck, which was originally a small car in the script. The choice of a truck implies that Sara will be travelling far, and Harding felt ""a mixture of nervous trepidation and excitement for Sara"".[8] Foster said: ""I want her to close that door on this chapter, this town, on that relationship, and become who she is.""[9] Foster flew to London to help Brooker with the episode's editing—the first time she had met him.[7][9] The song ""I'm a Mother"" by the Pretenders plays during the credits, chosen as a ""plaintive song"" which reminds viewers of ""the mother's perspective"", according to Foster.[8]

In May 2017, a Reddit post unofficially announced the names and directors of the six episodes in series 4 of Black Mirror.[14] The first trailer for the series was released by Netflix on 25 August 2017, and contained the six episode titles.[15][16] In September 2017, two photos from the fourth season were released, including one from ""Arkangel"".[17] Beginning on 24 November 2017, Netflix published a series of daily posters and trailers for the fourth series, referred to as the ""13 Days of Black Mirror"".[18] The first poster and trailer were of ""Arkangel"".[19] On 6 December, Netflix published a trailer featuring an amalgamation of scenes from the fourth series, which announced that the series would be released on 29 December.[20]

As intended by Foster, critics saw the episode as being set in working-class America.[8] The Atlantic's Sophie Gilbert found it ""set in a nondescript EveryTown USA"" and ""deliberately muted"".[21] Steve O'Brien of Digital Spy saw it as more ""thrillingly, authentically American"" than any prior episode.[22] Louisa Mellor of Den of Geek found that the blue-collar setting contrasts with most previous episodes' depictions of ""shiny near-futures, in chic, modernist homes"". She also highlighted the episode as the most female-heavy with regard to characters to that point.[23] Paste's Jacob Oller commented that the camera shows multiple perspectives throughout the episode: first-person, third-person and first-person from another person's perspective. Oller saw this as giving the episode a horror feel, heightened by the ""long-short-long editing"" pattern of ""tension, release, rebuild"".[24] Caroline Framke of Vox saw Foster's directing as ""generally stark and matter-of-fact"", though a handheld camera is used when characters are in ""a particular state of panic"" so that the framing shows ""their confused and rapidly fracturing relationship to each other and the world around them"".[25] Christopher Hooton of The Independent compared the injured Marie yelling on the street to a similar performance by Anna Gunn as Skyler White in the crime drama Breaking Bad.[26]

The episode has a theme of helicopter parenting. Entertainment Weekly's Darren Franich saw it as a ""straightforward parable""; both Franich and Vulture's Charles Bramesco compared the episode to an after school special due to its simple moral message.[27][28] In Variety, Sonia Saraiya wrote that it was ""so blatant it could bludgeon you"", the message being: ""If you love it, let it go"".[29] Mellor found that relevant questions raised include where the ""right to privacy and agency"" of a child overrides the ""power of a parent"", and whether pain is an ""instructive"" or ""traumatising"" formative experience.[23] Framke saw the episode as a case of the programme's ""overall ethos that pretty much everything we try in the name of protecting ourselves and each other will eventually, inevitably backfire"", in that Marie trying to shield Sara is only ""a temporary salve"".[25] Bramesco compared the episode's storyline to that of Spring Awakening, a 1906 play later adapted into a 2000s musical: the play depicts teenagers developing sexual awareness after a lack of parental sex education.[28] Gilbert commented on a similarity between the Arkangel's functionality and that of the Z-Eyes from the Black Mirror episode ""White Christmas"".[21]

Critics identified various technologies in the real world as relevant to the episode's themes. Oller compared Arkangel to radio-frequency identification (RFID) implants used in animals, while Tasha Robinson of The Verge commented that such implants have been used in humans.[24][31] Robinson further noted that there have been ""a long-running series of debates"" over the morality of using the implants in children.[31] Zoe Williams commented in The Guardian that GPS monitoring for children is frequently marketed in the form of a smartwatch, some of which can listen into the wearer's conversations. She found the underlying principle behind the technology to be ""that your perception of your child's vulnerability takes precedence over their interaction with the world"".[30] Robinson noted that clothing with trackers and third-party monitoring and control of a mobile phone are other technologies targeted at parents.[31]

The opening scene in which Marie gives birth serves to show her anxieties as a parent. Gilbert said that she feels ""frantic"" and briefly thinks her baby has died, which is ""every parent's worst fear"".[21] Mellor said that it shows Marie ""feels anxiety and guilt over not being a good-enough mother"" even before she begins parenting.[23] Robinson analysed that the episode uses the scene ""as a frame for how [Marie] projects her fears of inadequacy onto her daughter"".[31] O'Brien saw the doctor's line ""cutting the umbilical cord"" as reflecting symbolism that for Marie, ""it never was cut"".[22] Mellor said that Marie's isolation as a single parent, ill father and long working hours are all contributing factors to her guilt.[23] Similarly, O'Brien commented that Marie has little in her life outside of Sara and that few of her interactions with Sara ""aren't finger-wagging"".[22] Bramesco saw Marie as ""the one at fault"" in the episode, with Trick portrayed as ""a pretty decent guy"" and Sara's drug usage not being seen as ""scandalizing"".[28]

The reproductive healthcare organisation Planned Parenthood criticised the depiction of emergency contraceptive (EC) pills as inaccurate. A nurse tells Sara that the purpose of such a pill is ""terminating your pregnancy"", but this is a description of abortion rather than contraception.[32] Contraception prevents the fertilisation of an egg before a person becomes pregnant.[33]

The episode received mixed reception. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the episode a 78% rating based on 23 critics, with the summary: ""Though a bit too on the nose, 'Arkangel' brings balance to Black Mirror's typically frenetic episodes with a calm, contemplative, and compelling installment.""[34] The Telegraph awarded it three out of five stars while Vulture gave it two.[28][35] Paste rated it 8.6 out of 10 and The A.V. Club gave it a B+.[24][36] Robinson found it the ""weakest"" episode of the fourth series.[31]

Critics were split on the episode's storyline and message. Gilbert saw the premise as ""potent"" and Mellor as ""solid"", but Robinson saw the story as ""simplistic"".[21][23][31] Bramesco saw it as ""too far-fetched to accept"" that the Arkangel technology could be developed and used despite ""such glaring potential for calamity and/or human-rights violations"".[28] Saraiya found the story ""well-done"" and O'Brien found the ending ""beautifully ambiguous"".[22][29] The A.V. Club's Zach Handlen viewed the narrative arc as unsurprising but said that ""the specifics make it compelling""; he reviewed that the moral is ""hard to argue with"" but ""not really unexpected"".[36] Gilbert found the moral ""increasingly obvious"" once Sara lies to her mother about where she is going out for the evening, whilst Robinson said that the episode's ""sheer earnestness makes its simplicity and obviousness even more awkward"".[21][31] Handlen saw the conclusion as obvious in the context of past Black Mirror episodes, which ""robs the episode of freshness or surprise"".[36]

Many reviewers had criticisms of the episode's execution or focus, with Gilbert finding that the execution is where it ""sputters and dies"".[21] Robinson wrote that Brooker ""starts a story with infinite potential, then cuts it short just as it’s spinning up"".[31] Gilbert found the topic of young children being exposed to sexual and violent material from a young age more timely than helicopter parenting.[21] Ed Power, writing for The Telegraph, similarly found it a ""pity Brooker doesn't delve further"" into pornography's effects on Sara.[35] Robinson also thought it would have been interesting to explore Marie ""living through"" Sara when she begins young adulthood.[31] However, Bramesco praised that the episode is a ""rare meditation on the millennial generation that rightly looks to the parents for answers instead of blaming the youth"".[28] Hooton saw the film Men, Women & Children (2014) as exploring similar themes to ""Arkangel"" but with stronger execution.[26]

Foster's directing and casting was the subject of much commentary. Gilbert wrote that the ""lo-fi, indie feel Foster gives the episode captures the terrible ordinariness of the situation"", praising ""unforgettable images"" and ""foreboding framing"".[21]
Mellor found that Foster constructed a ""sensitive and emotional US indie-movie style"", while Handlen noted that she ""captures the show's clinical, mournful feel, but manages a necessary level of intimacy that keeps the story from being overly schematic"".[23][36] In contrast, Hooton saw the episode as ""visually flat"" and Bramesco wrote that Foster engages in ""misunderstanding the emotional timbre a scene should have"".[24][26]

Franich and Power praised the performances as ""fine"" and ""compelling"", respectively, with both praising Foster for her direction of the younger actors.[27][35] However, Hooton saw the actors as ""miscast"".[26] DeWitt's portrayal of Marie received praise for balancing positive and negative traits, by critics Oller, Handlen and Power.[24][35][36] Mellor praised a ""deft balance"" in that Brooker and Foster ""have taken pains not to demonise, but to create a likeable, easy-to-relate-to character"" in Marie.[23] Oller praised Marie's confrontation of Trick as ""epic, expertly realized and emotionally grounded"".[24] Contrastingly, Bramesco criticised the climax as ""abrupt and melodramatic"", resulting in ""incredulous snorts"" rather than ""gasps"".[28]

""Arkangel"" ranked poorly on critics' lists of the 23 instalments of Black Mirror, from best to worst:



IndieWire authors ranked the 22 Black Mirror instalments excluding Bandersnatch by quality, giving ""Arkangel"" a position of 20th.[45] Eric Anthony Glover of Entertainment Tonight found the episode to be 12th-best of the 19 episodes from series one to four.[46] Instead of by quality, Proma Khosla of Mashable ranked the episodes by tone, concluding that ""Arkangel"" is the 11th-most pessimistic episode of the show.[47]

Other reviewers ranked ""Arkangel"" against other series four episodes:



For his work on ""Arkangel"", Malcolm McCulloch was nominated for a Location Managers Guild Awards in the category of Outstanding Locations in a Contemporary Television Series.[50]
"
Crocodile,"

""Crocodile"" is the third episode of the fourth series of the anthology series Black Mirror. It was written by series creator Charlie Brooker and directed by John Hillcoat. The episode first aired on Netflix, along with the rest of series four, on 29 December 2017.

The episode follows Mia (Andrea Riseborough) fifteen years after she helped her friend Rob (Andrew Gower) cover up a hit-and-run death, as she commits several murders in order to cover up her past crimes. Meanwhile, Shazia (Kiran Sonia Sawar) is an insurance investigator who uses a ""Recaller"" that can project people's visual memories onto a screen. The writers were inspired by Nordic noir and by a similar memory technology in series one's ""The Entire History of You"". The first draft featured a male protagonist and Scotland as its setting. It was filmed in Iceland.

The episode garnered mixed reviews. Critics mostly found its bleakness and violence to be excessive, with further criticism of the plot twists. Some reviewers found the Recaller technology to be interesting, but not meaningfully explored by the episode. Riseborough and Sawar's acting, as well as the visual aesthetics, were acclaimed.

Driving intoxicated after a party, Rob (Andrew Gower) hits a cyclist on a mountain road, killing him. Rob's companion Mia Nolan (Andrea Riseborough) helps him throw the body off a cliff into a lake.

Fifteen years later, Mia is married with a nine-year-old son and works as an architect. After she delivers an important presentation, a newly-sober Rob meets her at her hotel. He is going to write an anonymous letter to the victim's wife, after seeing a news article indicating she never moved on, but Mia is afraid the letter will be traced. An argument ensues and Mia breaks Rob's neck, killing him. Out of the window, she notices a self-driving pizza delivery truck hit a pedestrian. Playing pornography in the room as an alibi, she disposes of Rob's body.

The pedestrian is visited by Shazia (Kiran Sonia Sawar), an insurance investigator who uses a ""Recaller"" to view his memories, as best as he can picture them, on a screen. She finds a woman he passed on the street before the incident, who directs her to a dentist, who saw Mia looking at the accident from her hotel room. In each case Shazia makes them smell beer from the nearby brewery and replays a song that played in a passing car to strengthen their memories. Hoping to get bonus pay from a quick investigation, Shazia makes a lengthy drive to meet Mia.

A tense Mia only allows Shazia in when told that refusal will be reported to the police. Mia tries to divert her memory away from the accident but fails, and Shazia sees memories of both of her killings. Shazia tries to leave but her car does not start and Mia smashes the window, knocks her out and ties her up in a shed.

Mia disbelieves Shazia's promise to keep the information secret, and uses the Recaller to learn that Shazia had told her husband Anan (Anthony Welsh) her whereabouts. Mia kills Shazia, drives to her house and, masked, kills Anan as he bathes. As Mia exits, having removed her mask, she sees the couple's baby son babbling in front of her and kills him so as not to leave a witness. However, the baby was born blind.

Police use the Recaller on the baby's pet guinea pig, which had observed the final murder. Officers then quietly arrive at the ending of Mia's son's school production of Bugsy Malone, where she is in the audience.

Whilst series one and two of Black Mirror were shown on Channel 4 in the UK, in September 2015 Netflix commissioned the series for 12 episodes,[1] and in March 2016 it outbid Channel 4 for the rights to distribute the series in the UK, with an offer of $40 million.[2] The twelve-episode order was divided into two series of six episodes each, with ""Crocodile"" in the latter group. The six episodes in series four were released on Netflix simultaneously on 29 December 2017.[3] ""Crocodile"" is listed as the third episode, but as Black Mirror is an anthology series, each instalment can be watched in any order.[4]

The episode was written by the series creator Charlie Brooker, with Annabel Jones as executive producer. It was inspired by the series one episode ""The Entire History of You"", which featured a personal implant that a person could use privately to review their memories. According to Jones, they considered what the situation would be like if these memories were not private, developing a ""cat-and-mouse type drama"" that would highlight the importance of memories, and to what lengths someone with a secret would go to conceal them.[5]

In its original form, the script involved a woman who, at the age of two, had seen her mother die, causing her to become an anxious and fearful person. Brooker compared this to a virtual reality trip down a jungle river with random events: one person may have an enjoyable experience despite some negative happenstances, but an unlucky person may be attacked by a crocodile almost immediately and, thinking that they are in a ""crocodile attack simulator"", be anxious for the rest of the game. While the script significantly changed over the course of production, the title was established as ""Crocodile"" because of this analogy.[6][7]

The episode was initially conceived with a male protagonist. Andrea Riseborough read the script to audition for the insurance investigator, who was later renamed Shazia and played by Kiran Sonia Sawar.[7] However, Riseborough liked the journey of the protagonist and asked if the part could be rewritten as a woman.[8] Both Brooker and Jones described the change as interesting, with Jones asking, ""How often do you see a mother reduced to this level of desperation?""[8][9] Though they questioned whether a woman would have the physical strength to dispose of a body, Riseborough argued that her character could find that strength in desperation. Brooker commented that ""the panicking male murderer is practically a trope"", so the gender change was ""refreshing"".[7]

The episode ends with Mia killing Shazia's son, who turns out to be blind, and her murder is witnessed by a guinea pig. This was intended as dark humour in the tone of 1996 black comedy thriller Fargo, though the episode had been more serious up until that point. Mia then watches her son in a stage adaptation of the 1976 musical film Bugsy Malone, which starred Jodie Foster—the director of the preceding episode ""Arkangel"".[7]

The episode was directed by John Hillcoat, who described the episode as a ""pitch-black comedy of errors"". Hillcoat said that ""Crocodile"" is about ""how human beings actually work and how we would respond to something the tech revolution may well bring into our lives"".[7] The memory reader technology was conceived by Brooker with the arcade machine for Space Invaders in mind. Production designer Joel Collins compares it to a slide viewer, contrasting with the thin screens of contemporary devices. After the memory reader was designed, other technology in the episode such as the pizza truck were re-designed with similar box styles.[7]

The episode was shot in Iceland and includes scenes filmed in the Harpa concert hall.[8] Brooker had originally called for filming in Scotland in his script, but he later said that Netflix suggested Iceland as a ""stunning backdrop"".[10] Hillcoat commented that the ""cruel inescapable logic"" of Mia's actions were suited for Icelandic ""strange, vast and primeval landscapes"".[7] During filming, Iceland had its largest snowfall in forty years.[10] The scenes involving the pizza van were the worst affected, with shooting taking place over two nights. Snow needed to be continually brushed and special effects teams used heaters and hoses on important areas in frame. A line of dialogue about snow was added, the intention being that the difference in snow was a consequence of observers' differing memories.[7][10]

Riseborough's performance as Mia was less panicked than Brooker had pictured when writing the episode. Hillcoat opined that Mia has ambition as a ""deep inner flaw"", whereas Jones thought her actions was a ""logical inevitability"" of her initially protecting her friend Rob. Brooker said that Mia ""really turns"" when she hides Rob's body, rather than confessing to causing his death. In her first rehearsal, Riseborough injured her ribs. Sawar found the scene in which her character Shazia was killed by Mia difficult to film, and was unable to watch the scene in the finished episode.[7]

In May 2017, a Reddit post unofficially announced the names and directors of the six episodes in series 4 of Black Mirror.[11] The first trailer for the series was released by Netflix on 25 August 2017, and contained the six episode titles.[12][13] Beginning on 24 November 2017, Netflix published a series of daily posters and trailers for the fourth series, referred to as the ""13 Days of Black Mirror"".[14] The trailer for ""Crocodile"" was the second to be released, on 27 November 2017.[15] On 6 December, Netflix published a trailer featuring an amalgamation of scenes from the fourth series, which announced that the series would be released on 29 December.[16]

The writers were inspired by the aesthetic of Nordic noir, a genre of crime fiction in the Nordic countries.[17][18] David Sims of The Atlantic additionally identified elements of psychological thriller, and Charles Bramesco of Vulture found ""a familiar series of law-and-order beats"".[19][20] Shazia has the ""detective role"" in the story, according to Nick Harley of Den of Geek.[21] Harley and The Guardian's Lanre Bakare both found it one of the bleakest episodes of Black Mirror, and Paste's Jacob Oller wrote that there was an ""unrelenting pessimism at the heart of the story"".[21][22][23]

Critics suggested various motivations or emotions behind Mia's actions. Louisa Mellor of Den of Geek found her to be ""traumatised by her actions but ... stuck on a murderous path from which she can't turn back"".[18] The Telegraph's Chris Harvey saw a message that ""there in all of us, a long way down"" is the propensity to murder.[24] Prior to her killing spree, Bramesco found that Mia was ""trying her best to be a dutiful mother and wife while pursuing excellence as an architecture expert"".[20] Writing for The Verge, Laura Hudson viewed that Mia ""benefits from the presumption of innocence"" as a white woman, and that she is ""effective"" as ""an unlikely killer"". Hudson noted that most of Mia's victims are people of colour and drew comparisons to Get Out (2017), a horror film which she said ""positioned white femininity as the canny, quiet heart of its violence"".[25] Oller saw Mia's predicament as like the video game Until Dawn (2015), describing that in the game ""your every decision begins a series of butterfly effects"".[23]

Some critics drew connections between the title and the idiom ""crocodile tears"", which refers to insincere expressions of sorrow. Rosie Fletcher of Digital Spy commented that Mia is seen crying in the episode, and initially seems much more emotional than Rob about the car crash death, but Fletcher says that she becomes ""a completely ruthless and cold killer"".[26] Zack Handlen, a reviewer for The A.V. Club, saw an ambiguity over whether Mia's grief was insincere, suggesting that it could be ""all for show"" or because ""no matter how awful she feels, she keeps pushing forward"".[27] Hudson compared her ""pseudo-sympathetic tears"" to a line from Shakespeare's Hamlet that a person can ""smile and smile and smile and be a villain"".[25] Jason Koebler of Vice noted that Mia does not read the End-User License Agreement (EULA) for the Recaller, and suggests that Shazia is lying about the ""legal requirement"" to use the Recaller, as she previously implied Mia could opt out. Thus, Mia reading the EULA could have allowed her to decline, and the later murders would not have happened.[28]

Kevin P. Sullivan of Entertainment Weekly saw the technology in the episode as ""the means to another end and a different message entirely"", though Hudson wrote that it was ""hard to identify a takeaway"".[29] Some questions were raised by the Recaller. Hudson said it was ""an obvious proxy for the increasingly invasive ways our lives are surveilled, from cameras to face-recognition to data theft"".[25] Handlen viewed that the episode asks: ""Is it ethical to force people to reveal their memories? Is it just another form of police questioning, or something more sinister?""[27] Alissa Wilkinson of Vox found it ""frightening"" that ""memories are not just unreliable, but suggestible"". In the episode, one person's memory is seen to change when Shazia tells the person what colour a woman's jacket was. Wilkinson thought that this could be misused by a malicious employee in the justice system.[30]

In January 2018, Toyota announced its self-driving delivery vehicle, the e-Palette. One of their partnerships was with Pizza Hut, to create a self-driving pizza delivery truck. This led to comparisons to the truck with the same function in ""Crocodile"".[31] The official Twitter account for Black Mirror replied to the announcement with ""We know how this goes.""[32]

Comparisons were made to other Black Mirror episodes. In terms of the genre, Bramesco found that the instalment ""pivots into a two-pronged procedural"" like that of ""Hated in the Nation"".[20] In relation to the technology, the ""grain"" in ""The Entire History of You"" records one's vision and hearing exactly, whereas in ""Crocodile"" the Recaller is dependent on imperfect recollections.[21] In ""Crocodile"", the song ""Anyone Who Knows What Love Is (Will Understand)"" plays—it became a recurring feature of Black Mirror after Abi sang it in ""Fifteen Million Merits"". The talent show Hot Shots and pornography channel WraithBabes, two other features of ""Fifteen Million Merits"", are also mentioned in ""Crocodile"". Other ""Easter egg"" references to Black Mirror instalments include the appearance of UKN, a news channel from ""The National Anthem"", and the pizza company Fence's, which also features in ""USS Callister"". A newspaper article briefly shown also contains the text: ""Of course the real question is why anyone would pause what they're watching just to read a sentence in a printed out newspaper article, says a voice in your head — before advising you to go and share this finding on Reddit"".[33][34][35]

The episode received mixed critical reception, with consensus that the technological themes could have been explored further and that the ending was gratuitously dark, but that the characters were well-acted and the setting was aesthetically pleasing. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the episode received positive reviews from 53% of 19 critics, with an average rating of 6.39/10. The site's summary says that the episode is ""beautiful but blunt"" and that its ""nightmarish concept can't quite overcome its own shallow nihilism.""[36] Out of five stars, the episode received a rating of three stars in Vulture and The Telegraph and 2.5 stars in Den of Geek.[20][21][24] Additionally, Paste rated it 7.1 out of 10 and The A.V. Club gave it a B−.[23][27]

Handlen said that the episode was the ""thinnest from a conceptual standpoint"" of the series four episodes, that there was ""not a lot to this story"" and that its plot becomes ""clear"" when the Recaller's functionality is established.[27] Wilkinson wrote that it ""doesn't feel all that innovative"" and Sims felt ""emotionally and intellectually unfilfilled"". Harvey said it was ""a little too predictable"". In contrast, Mellor had a more positive response, calling it ""stunning to look at, very sick and very funny"".[18] Critics mostly found the bleakness to be unjustified: Vulture's Jen Chaney wrote that it was ""filled with so much brutal, senseless violence"", comparing it unfavourably to the episode ""Black Museum"".[37] Harley saw it as ""grossly over the top"" and ""the most mean-spirited"" Black Mirror episode to date.[21] Sims wrote that it ""didn't seem to have much of a deeper point"".[19]

Reviewing for Wired, James Temperton said that the episode ""raises genuinely interesting questions about technological advancement"", though there is a question of how the Recaller would become ""universally accepted"".[17] Hudson saw the design of the Recall as having ""a lot of potential"" that ""is largely wasted"" and Harley concurred that the episode ""never really takes advantage"" of the idea of ""distortions of recalled events"".[21][25] Similarly, Handlen said it was ""frustrating how much time the episode spends developing its technology without that development actually leading to anything relevant"".[27] Sims wrote that ""there seemed to be no broader message to justify the horror"".[19] However, Harvey saw the Recaller as ""a fascinating example of how science-fiction does not need vast budgets to play with interesting ideas"".[24]

The ending was mostly criticised. Handlen summarised: ""while both reveals are unexpected, neither of them illuminate anything that came before it"".[27] Hudson saw the ""dramatic irony"" in the baby's blindness, but critiqued that ""it arrives abruptly and without setup"".[25] Bramesco saw the twist that the baby was blind as ""needlessly cruel"" and Bakare analysed that it was ""a step too far for many"".[20][22] Hudson said that the guinea pig being used to catch Mia ""makes no sense, even within the episode's techno-mythos"", though Mellor found this twist funny.[18][25] Oller said that the ending overall was ""written well enough that the dread precedes the groans"", but contained ""enough overkill"" and was ""more than a bit silly"".[18][23]

The acting received acclaim, although Mia's character was criticised. Sullivan lauded that ""Riseborough's performance is as close to undeniable as they come"".[29] Sims said she was a ""wonderful actress"" and ""almost sold [him] on Mia's abrupt descent into darkness early on in this episode"".[19] Harley said that she was ""steely and reserved"" but shows emotion ""at all of the right times"", so that Mia does not become ""a complete heartless sadist"".[21] In contrast, The Independent's Jacob Stolworthy saw her as ""perhaps the most unlikeable creation to have featured in Black Mirror"" to that point, and it was ""unclear"" whether that was intentional.[38] Chaney said that Mia's actions ""seem completely out of character"" given her initial behaviour after the car crash.[37] Sawar was praised, with Harley saying that she employed a ""bright, plucky determinism"" as Shazia.[21] Oller said that her ""professionalism and personal touch"" was ""endearing"" and desirable in a detective character.[23] Additionally, Sims found it pleasant to see Shazia assembling information ""methodically but with empathy and care"".[19]

The aesthetics were praised: for instance, Hudson found them ""austere and beautiful"" and Temperton commented that the episode ""looks magnificent"".[17][25] Handlen said: ""The Icelandic setting is gorgeous, managing to convey the characters' isolation and vulnerability with visuals alone"".[27] Hillcoat was praised for his directing work by Stolworthy, who found the episode ""often stylistically pleasing"".[38] Oller enjoyed the ""unflinching, up-close grotesquery"" in his direction.[23] Chaney saw Hillcoat as ""summoning a frostbitten grimness from forbidding territory"", made possible by the ""vivid, evocative setting"".[20]

""Crocodile"" received middling rankings on critics' lists of the 23 instalments of Black Mirror by quality, from best to worst:

IndieWire authors ranked the 22 Black Mirror instalments excluding Bandersnatch by quality, putting ""Crocodile"" in last place.[47] Eric Anthony Glover of Entertainment Tonight found the episode to be second-worst of the 19 episodes from series one to four.[48] Instead of by quality, Proma Khosla of Mashable ranked the episodes by tone, concluding that ""Crocodile"" is the 12th-most pessimistic episode of the show.[49]

Other reviewers ranked ""Crocodile"" against other series four episodes:

Hang the DJ,"

""Hang the DJ"" is the fourth episode of the fourth series of the British anthology series Black Mirror. It was written by series creator Charlie Brooker and directed by Tim Van Patten. The episode first aired on Netflix, along with the rest of series four, on 29 December 2017. It follows Amy (Georgina Campbell) and Frank (Joe Cole), who are matched into relationships for fixed lengths of time by an algorithm that eventually determines their life-long partner.

The episode was inspired by the streaming service Spotify, as Brooker considered a system which gives people ""playlists"" of relationships. The production designer Joel Collins's visit to an expensive holiday area became the basis for the setting, while the simulation ending and app display had to be simplified and reworked to avoid audience confusion.

Critics drew parallels between the episode and online dating through apps such as Tinder, and made comparisons to the series three episode ""San Junipero"", among other works. The episode received positive reception according to Rotten Tomatoes and was nominated for three British Academy Television Awards (BAFTAs), but critics wrote mixed comments about the storyline and the final twist, though were mostly favourable towards the characters of Frank and Amy.

Frank (Joe Cole) and Amy (Georgina Campbell) use a circular device called ""Coach"" that matches them with partners for fixed periods of time. They are matched together for 12 hours. Despite initial nerves, they quickly get on and regret not having sex as they part. Coach (voice of Gina Bramhill) tells them the system monitors each relationship to assign them a lifelong partner on ""pairing day"", with a success rate of 99.8%.

Frank's next match Nicola (Gwyneth Keyworth) immediately disdains him, but they are paired for a year. Meanwhile, Amy finds her nine-month match Lenny (George Blagden) attractive. Amy and Frank meet again, at an event where a couple talk about their successful pairing. Amy begins to find Lenny's mannerisms tiresome, particularly his heavy exhalations. After the relationship ends, she is repeatedly matched with people for 36 hours; having sex with each match, she begins to dissociate over the matches' pointlessness.

After Frank's match ends, he and Amy are matched again and they agree not to check the time length, to avoid preconceptions. They enjoy having sex for the first time and talk about how the system might work. One night, Frank checks the expiry date. It initially says five years but recalibrates, as Frank's betrayal of their agreement has destabilised it, until it reads 20 hours. Frank is distracted the next day as Amy notices every pebble she skips hits the water four times; he admits what has happened with an hour remaining. She is furious and he is heartbroken.

They continue matches to no avail. The evening before Amy's pairing day, she chooses Frank for her one permitted farewell session before skipping Coach across a swimming pool. At dinner with Frank, whose pairing day is also tomorrow, she encourages him to leave with her. Recognising that neither of them have memories prior to the system, she thinks the world is a test and they must rebel. A man with a taser approaches; Amy touches the taser and it stops working, and the people in the restaurant freeze. Frank and Amy run and scale a wall that separates the outside world. The world is revealed to be one of 1000 simulated realities constructed around Frank and Amy—in 998 of the simulations, they rebelled to be together. In the real world, Amy's dating application says Frank is a 99.8% match and they make eye contact for the first time across a bar, as ""Panic"" by the Smiths plays.[a]

Whilst series one and two of Black Mirror were shown on Channel 4 in the UK, in September 2015 Netflix commissioned the series for 12 episodes,[2] and in March 2016 it outbid Channel 4 for the rights to distribute the series in the UK, with a bid of $40 million.[3] The 12-episode order was divided into two series of six episodes each, with ""Hang the DJ"" in the latter group. The six episodes in series four were released on Netflix simultaneously on 29 December 2017.[4] ""Hang the DJ"" is listed as the fourth episode, but as Black Mirror is an anthology series, each instalment can be watched in any order.[5]

According to the executive producer Annabel Jones, ""Hang the DJ"" reflects on the state of dating in the present day and a ""general sense of loneliness"".[6] The episode originated from series creator and episode writer Charlie Brooker, who conceived of the Coach dating application by analogy with the audio streaming platform Spotify: it determines a ""playlist"" of relationships that one should have before settling down with a partner.[7][8] It was not obvious what storyline could be developed when the dating application users' experience was predetermined. Variations were considered and one idea floated was that the app could learn from each relationship. Amy and Frank being driven apart before reuniting was a desired narrative arc, and became possible when the twist was introduced. The script was rushed because of its deadline at a busy point in the production cycle.[7]

The episode is similar to series three episode ""San Junipero"" in its positivity, in contrast to other instalments. Brooker was concerned about fans disliking the ""light and playful comic tone"" of ""Hang the DJ"" and was initially reluctant to write a happy ending. However, he expected people to enjoy Amy and Frank's relationship, having seen positive audience reaction to Kelly and Yorkie in ""San Junipero"". Both episodes reveal in a twist that the setting is a simulated reality.[7] One challenge with ""Hang the DJ"" was to keep this unclear until the very end while still making the viewer aware that the setting is unusual.[6] In one scene, Frank and Amy suggest that the world is simulated, as a ""double-bluff"" from Brooker.[7]

The writers discussed how long Frank should initially see as his second relationship length with Amy. Brooker said their ultimate decision of five years is ""a reasonable amount of time for a serious relationship"", but Frank is disappointed to discover this as it means the relationship will end.[9] Frank observing the relationship time caused a structural issue in the script, but the scene was seen as important and so the script was reworked around this idea.[7]

Brooker imagined that the simulation would be run using cloud computing.[9] The idea that it runs 1000 copies of the world simultaneously was first considered for a previous episode ""White Christmas"". In the episode, a simulated copy of a person confesses to a crime. Someone asked Brooker whether this would be admissible evidence and he replied that the simulation could be repeated, with a slightly different setting each time, to increase reliability.[7] For simulated couples who did not rebel, Brooker said ""the system has served its purpose and your reality ends"".[9]

American director Tim Van Patten directed the episode. Georgina Campbell was cast as Amy and Joe Cole was cast as Frank. The pair performed a chemistry test before filming, to check they could build a rapport. Campbell found Amy to be ""full to the brim with hope"", with a ""nervous excitement"" about dating.[7]

The setting was based on Soho Farmhouse in Oxfordshire, an expensive holiday area where production designer Joel Collins had attended a birthday party. He described that an ""electric milk float"" transports people around their cabins and the various clubs and bars. The setting was rewritten around this—having previously been drafted as tower blocks—to resemble Soho Farmhouse, or a holiday village owned by Center Parcs. The geometric design of the world was Collins's idea, intended to resemble the inside of a mobile phone—where various copper and brass lines are arranged on a green plate. Hexagonal patterns and repeated design motifs are used in the scenery as the setting is an algorithmic simulated world. The interface for the Coach app was first designed by Erica McEwan of the graphics department of the production. Further development and animation was undertaken by Painting Practice.[7] Collins said that the round design of Coach was made to distinguish the setting from the real world. Its interface was deliberately minimal, with few buttons; Collins called it ""just a circular disc, almost like a discus, with a glass screen"".[10]

Some exterior filming took place at Painshill, an eighteenth-century landscape park in Surrey. In one scene, Amy kicks Frank jokingly. However, Campbell's fake kicks looked unrealistic. Van Patten told Campbell to kick Cole for real and she accidentally kicked him hard enough for him to bleed—this was the shot that was used in the episode.[7] Woodland scenes were filmed at Bourne Wood, Surrey.[11]

The plot twist is revealed in a scene where the simulated world disassembles pixel by pixel to be replaced by 1000 copies of Frank and Amy in a black void. This was only described vaguely in the script, so the production took inspiration from 2013 science fiction film Under the Skin, according to producer Nick Pitt. The cast were confused about the intention during filming for this ending, particularly the footage taken against green screens of characters looking ""meaningfully into the middle distance"". Jones and Brooker found that their partners did not understand the initial cuts of the ending. To establish that the episode's setting had been a simulation, disembodied voice and text reveal that Amy and Frank had ""rebelled"" 998 out of 1000 times, leading to a 99.8% match for the pair, and dialogue in the previous restaurant scene was simplified. Additionally, visual effects developments led to characters ""dematerialising"" by a ""graceful leaving of their body"" rather than ""being broken, squashed or incinerated"", according to Pitt.[7]

The episode draws its name from a lyric in the Smiths' song ""Panic"", which plays in the final scene.[1] The instrumental soundtrack for ""Hang the DJ"" was created by Alex Somers, with two pieces contributed by the Icelandic band Sigur Rós, ""End"" and ""Match"". The two songs are both ambient music: ""End"" is a five-minute structured piece featuring vocals by Jónsi, which Rolling Stone's Ryan Reed described as post-rock; ""Match"" is a 90-second segue with a dark tone and use of drones. Somers had previously produced music with the band, including on their most recent album Kveikur (2013).[12][13] In 2018, the soundtrack was released on vinyl by Invada Records.[14][15][16]

In May 2017, a Reddit post unofficially announced the names and directors of the six episodes in series 4 of Black Mirror.[17] The first trailer for the series was released by Netflix on 25 August 2017, and contained the six episode titles.[18][19] Beginning on 24 November 2017, Netflix published a series of daily posters and trailers for the fourth series, referred to as the ""13 Days of Black Mirror"".[20] The poster for ""Hang the DJ"" was released on 30 November and the trailer premiered the following day.[21] On 6 December, Netflix published a trailer featuring an amalgamation of scenes from the fourth series, which announced that the series would be released on 29 December.[22]

The episode is a romantic comedy; its subject matter of finding a person their ideal match drew comparisons to other works.[23][24] Jacob Oller of Paste and Louisa Mellor of Den of Geek compared it to The Lobster (2015), a film in which single people are coerced into finding relationships.[24][25] Mellor and Vulture's Jen Chaney made comparisons to The Good Place (2016–2020), a television programme which begins with characters in the afterlife being matched with their soulmates.[23][24] Other comparisons were made to media which revolve around a person being constantly monitored, such as the 1998 film The Truman Show and the 1949 novel Nineteen Eighty-Four.[23][26][27] Mellor also saw the ending as like that of the film When Harry Met Sally... (1989), as ""the couple who met right at the start end up together, and they're a near-perfect match"".[24]

Comparisons were also made to other Black Mirror episodes, particularly series three's ""San Junipero"". Kathryn VanArendonk of Vulture found that both episodes were intended as hopeful, and showed ""love enabled by technological advancement and two people choosing one another over the world they know"".[28] Shirley Li of Entertainment Weekly saw similarities like ""the star-crossed couple"" and ""the impossible parameters set around them"" but also found ""Hang the DJ"" to be ""more absurd, more sinister, and less optimistic and warm in its conclusion"".[29] Sophie Gilbert of The Atlantic saw the twist as also relating to other episodes featuring simulated people, including ""USS Callister"" and ""White Christmas"".[30] Additionally, The Atlantic's Hannah Giorgis later compared it to the television anthology series Soulmates (2020), which also stars Campbell and was co-created by Black Mirror writer William Bridges. It follows a near-future in which there is a scientific basis for determining one's ""soulmate"" with complete accuracy. Giorgis wrote that in both works, ""romantic tension is just a proxy for larger questions about safety, security, and belonging"".[31]

During ""Hang the DJ"", Frank suggests to Amy that they are in a simulation, which turns out to be correct.[32] The setting initially presented to the audience raises many questions: Oller said that there are ""so many strange and seemingly contradictory hints at the way the world works"".[25] Relevant initial questions, according to Gilbert, are: why the characters seem to ""live inside some kind of sealed dome""; what happens if they opt out of the system; and ""Why, given that Frank and Amy have so much obvious chemistry, isn't the system pairing them up for longer?"" She described the location as having an ""artificial-world sheen"" similar to that seen in series three's ""Nosedive"".[30] The Verge reviewer Lizzie Plaugic saw the setting as ""flat and neutral"" and suggested that its display of characters who ""generally have nothing to do but kill time"" was like that of ""a Victorian-novel romance"".[33] Mellor saw this ""simplicity"" and ""stylish emptiness"" as logical for a ""virtual world"".[24]

The episode relates to online dating. A Pew Research Center study around the time of the episode found that about a quarter of Americans in the age range 18–24 used dating applications.[33] Vox's Abad-Santos listed Bumble, Grindr, Hinge, Scruff and Tinder as popular dating applications.[34] Plaugic saw Coach as ""not unlike"" the world of dating applications, which ""collect enough data to effectively push products at users, or predict human behavior"", including apps ""that collect data about your dates to determine whether you actually like them"".[33] Christopher Hooton, writing in The Independent, saw a parallel between Frank and Amy's dating and ""people who put themselves on a conveyor belt of Tinder dates though they are still not truly over their exes"".[35] Gilbert found Amy's ""sped-up montage of different relationships and sexual encounters as if outside her own body, detached and dehumanized"" to be a possible ""critique of Tinder"".[30]

Critics offered various suggestions of the episode's meaning. Abad-Santos saw the episode as embodying that ""humans will put themselves through anything for that promise of being loved forever"".[34] Plaugic wrote that its ""anxieties are related to social acceptance, loneliness, and the blank unknown of the future"".[33] Though Hooton saw the system as positive, saying the episode is ""about how absolutely ingenious they could be in the future without us even really knowing exactly how they come to their conclusions viz. dating algorithms"", Devon Maloney of Wired said that the system is ""intentionally depressing for us as an audience"", but marketed to characters ""as a solution to the problems that plagued single people of yesteryear"".[35][36] Li opined that the episode shows dating applications both positively and negatively, as the romance of Frank and Amy ""has already started off artificially"".[29] Zach Handlen of The A.V. Club thought that the audience feels a ""tension between the fantasy of a world where someone else makes the messy decisions for you, and the reflexive concern that this has to be a trap"".[27] Writing in Den of Geek, Alec Bojalad found Amy and Frank to be ""perfect for each other"", as they share a sense of humour and ""a clear physical connection"".[37] Catherine Gee of The Telegraph saw them as similarly ""sweet"" and ""goofy"" with a fondness for ""bad jokes"".[38] Abad-Santos interpreted their reaction to each other in the real world as ""a wink and a smile, and the flicker of true love"".[34] VanArendonk analysed the lyrics ""hang the DJ"" as ""a celebration of fighting the power and doing it for yourself"".[28]

Though rated highly according to some metrics, the episode received mixed reception for its storyline and final twist, along with acclaim for the acting and characterisation of Frank and Amy. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the episode has a 92% score based on 24 critics, reflecting universal acclaim. The site's summary describes it as ""surprisingly sweet and satisfyingly slight"" and with ""a welcome dose of optimism"".[39] It received a five-star rating in Den of Geek, a four-star rating from The Telegraph and ratings of A− in Entertainment Weekly and The A.V. Club, but a more ambivalent rating of 6.2 out of 10 in Paste.[25][27][29][37][38] Maloney praised that it ""perfectly captures the modern desperation of trusting algorithms to find us love"" and found it moving enough to cry at the ending.[36] Handlen and Thrillist's Sean Fitz-Gerald experienced the ending more positively, calling it ""a happy ending that still manages to be slightly unexpected"" and a ""refreshing dose of optimism ... that shows this anthology is still at its best when it dares to take risks"", respectively.[27][32]

The storyline received ambivalent reception. Abad-Santos found it ""a testament to the episode's storytelling"" that the viewer is ""attuned"" to ""the rhythms and structure of the dating app"" by the time Frank and Amy choose not to view their expiry date.[34] Gee said that ""without being preachy"", the story ""is more than what it first appears"".[38] Writing in The Guardian, Bakare praised the sex scenes as ""easily the funniest thing"" in the fourth series.[26] While Gilbert thought it ""sagged a little in the middle"", Mellor found it ""develops into a strong story"" over its runtime and Gee thought it was too short, at 51 minutes in length.[24][30][38] Plaugic critiqued it as ""intriguing, amusing, and sweet"" but ""not nearly as insightful"" as the previous episode ""Be Right Back"".[33] Hooton said the ""in-app world doesn't feel very rich and fully realised"".[35]

The twist received mixed reception. Critics such as Bakare praised it.[26] Gilbert said it made the episode ""more intriguing"" and praised a ""masterfully structured"" set of hints ""at a larger conspiracy"" throughout the episode.[30] Mellor concurred that it was ""cleverly seeded"", such as with Amy's comment about stones skipping four times, and enjoyed the ""impressive and poetic visual moments"" with the endless ladder and 1000 copies of Frank and Amy.[24] However, VanArendonk saw a contradiction between the storyline and the message of rebellion: ""The characters who actually make a choice ... get destroyed"" and ""in real life, Amy and Frank looked down at their phones and trusted an algorithm ... We have to root for them to blindly do whatever their phones tell them to do"".[28] Bojalad saw this not to be a negative, writing that ""the best part"" of the episode ""is how the tonal and thematic experiences remain the same before and after its twist"", because ""in both realities ... falling in love is the same. It's the experience of rebellion"".[37] However, more negative reception to the twist came from Oller, who said it is ""undermining its own reveal with its very nature"".[25] Handlen found it ""a little too neat"" and ""closed off"" for not questioning the feelings or rights of the simulated people.[27] Maloney said it was ""admittedly clever"" but ""can't quite bury the despair"" of the work.[36]

Campbell and Cole's acting garnered praise. Fitz-Gerald called their acting ""stellar"".[32] Gilbert praised them for a ""genuine rapport"" and Bojalad for ""excellent onscreen chemistry""; Mellor wrote that the ""chemistry between two very likeable and charismatic leads"" is ""what really sells this episode"".[24][30][37] Abad-Santos reviewed that they ""anchor the story"" and show a vulnerability to each character.[34] Handlen saw the writing, acting and directing as combining to ""immediately, but not forcefully, [establish] that these two make a good match"".[27] However, Hooton saw that some of the dialogue ""dials up the awkwardness way too much"" so that the characters ""feel more like parodies of millennials than actual ones"".[35] Additionally, the soundtrack was praised: Hooton lauded it as ""incredible"", while Maloney wrote that it was used to enhance ""the tenderness"" between Frank and Amy in their second relationship.[35][36]

""Hang the DJ"" was ranked as follows on critics' lists of the 23 instalments of Black Mirror by quality, from best to worst:



IndieWire authors ranked the 22 Black Mirror instalments excluding Bandersnatch by quality, giving ""Hang the DJ"" a position of 7th.[48] Eric Anthony Glover of Entertainment Tonight found the episode to be 14th-best of the 19 episodes from series one to four.[49] Instead of by quality, Proma Khosla of Mashable ranked the episodes by tone, concluding that ""Hang the DJ"" is the least pessimistic episode of the show.[50]

Other reviewers ranked ""Hang the DJ"" against other series four episodes:



""Hang the DJ"" was nominated for four awards: three British Academy Television Awards (BAFTAs) and a Black Reel Award.[53][54]

Metalhead,"

""Metalhead"" is the fifth episode of the fourth series of the anthology series Black Mirror. It was written by series creator Charlie Brooker and directed by David Slade. The episode first aired on Netflix, along with the rest of series four, on 29 December 2017.

""Metalhead"" is filmed in black and white, and it follows the plight of Bella (Maxine Peake) trying to flee from robotic ""dogs"" after the unexplained collapse of human society. The dogs were influenced by Boston Dynamics' robots such as BigDog. Filming took place in England, with Lidar scans used for scenes from the dog's perspective. Lasting 41 minutes, ""Metalhead"" is the second-shortest episode behind ""Mazey Day"".

Reviews were mostly positive. It has been compared to The Terminator, as both works feature machines chasing humans. The episode's message has been widely debated, with reviewers discussing questions about artificial intelligence and the final shot of a box of teddy bears. The plot and short running time have received mixed reviews, while Peake's acting and Slade's directing have been praised, along with the cinematography and the design of the dogs.

In a desolate landscape, Bella (Maxine Peake), Anthony (Clint Dyer), and Clarke (Jake Davies) drive to a warehouse searching for something to help ease the pain of Jack, who is dying. While Clarke hot-wires a van, Bella and Anthony break into the warehouse. They find the box they are looking for, but behind it is a four-legged robotic guard—a ""dog"". The dog sprays Bella and Anthony with shrapnel that contains trackers, then climbs down and shoots Anthony dead. Bella flees without the box to her car, with Clarke following in the van. The dog jumps into the van, kills Clarke and pursues Bella. It eventually enters her car, but she sends the car off a cliff and escapes.

Bella uses pliers to extract the tracker embedded in her leg. Over her walkie-talkie, she asks someone to pass a message to her loved ones in case she is killed. Bella is chased by the dog into a forest, climbing a nearby tree. The dog's forelimb was damaged in the car wreck, so it cannot climb the tree, and instead powers down and waits. Bella drains it of power by repeatedly throwing sweets at it, causing it to power up and down. When the dog no longer responds, Bella climbs down. She finds a compound and breaks in.

Bella takes car keys and a shotgun from two rotting corpses in the bedroom. When the sun rises, the dog recharges and gains access to the compound. As the dog approaches, Bella leaps out and throws paint over its visual sensor, then throws the paint can to the corner of the room to distract it and hurries to the car. However, the car will not start, so she turns on the radio and hides. As the dog investigates the noise, Bella shoots it. The dog stabs her in the leg; she shoots it again and it falls to the ground. The dog releases an air-burst shell, showering Bella with tracker-embedded shrapnel.

In the bathroom mirror, Bella sees many trackers in her face. She lifts a knife, but notices a tracker in her jugular vein. Bella speaks into her walkie-talkie, unsure if she can be heard, saying goodbye to her loved ones. As she puts the knife to her throat, the camera pans out over the landscape, showing dogs approaching and investigating. In the warehouse, the box's contents—dozens of teddy bears—have spilled onto the floor.

While series one and two of Black Mirror were shown on Channel 4 in the UK, Netflix commissioned the series for 12 episodes (split into two series of six episodes) in September 2015 with a bid of $40 million,[1][2] and in March 2016, Netflix outbid Channel 4 for the right to distribute the series in the UK.[2] The six episodes in series four were released on Netflix simultaneously on 29 December 2017.[3] ""Metalhead"" is listed as the fifth episode, though as each episode is standalone the episodes can be watched in any order.[4]

""Metalhead"" is the second-shortest episode of Black Mirror, with a length of 41 minutes[5] (at 40 minutes, ""Mazey Day"" is the shortest).[6] The episode was written by series creator Charlie Brooker and directed by David Slade. Maxine Peake stars in the episode as Bella. Joel Collins worked as the production designer.[7] With Al Green as music editor, the soundtrack features compositions by Krzysztof Penderecki and includes some pieces which were used in 1980 horror film The Shining.[8][9]

It was filmed in black and white, a style which had been considered for Black Mirror before but not previously used.[5] The idea was suggested by the director David Slade to bring to mind old horror films and to match the ""oppressive nature"" of the episode.[9][10] Brooker originally wanted the episode to be entirely free from dialogue,[11] similar to the film All Is Lost.[9] Brooker suggested using the Steven Spielberg films Duel and Jaws as inspiration, whilst The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was an influence for Slade.[12][13] Executive producer Annabel Jones felt that the story presented a world devoid of hope, and filming ""a world drained of color felt right"".[5] Slade reported that though biological events or apocalypses were considered, the episode does not suggest a backstory for the world in order to focus on the conflict between Bella and the dog.[13]

Brooker came up with the episode's central idea while watching videos of Boston Dynamics' robotics products such as BigDog. He found that there was something ""creepy"" in how the products, if knocked over, would look helpless as they worked to regain their stance. Brooker captured this idea in the scene where the dog breaks through the van's back window, but ends up off its legs.[14] The dogs have ""enough artificial intelligence to problem solve"", according to Slade, and they have no feelings, in contrast to many robots in fiction.[12][14] Their design underwent many iterations, the aim being that it should look terrifying, be designed with functionality in mind and kill brutally.[14]

Brooker's original script featured a human operating the dog from his home, including a scene where the operator left the ""control unit"" to give his kids a bath. However, this felt ""superfluous"", so the intention became for the episode to tell ""a very simple story"" and hence Brooker pared back the plot.[9] Though viewers may assume the dogs are security for the warehouse, where they are first seen, the intention was for the dogs to have been deployed during a war.[12][14] Camouflage for the dogs was designed but not used.[12] One physical model of a dog was created for the episode, to help give actors and production a concept of their size and shape, but otherwise, all dogs were digitally added in post-production. Visual effects company DNEG were hired to work on this.[14]

Slade initially received the script in June 2016, while finishing work on the first series of American Gods. Slade was involved in Peake's casting, and he had a large amount of autonomy during filming. A large amount of location scouting was carried out, with Slade looking for ""incredibly soft and overcast"" light and ""desolation"". The 12-day shoot took place in England, largely in Devon and around London.[10][12] With minimal dialogue in the episode, Slade noted that scenes were divided into many brief shots, as scenes utilising green screens would be difficult for Peake.[10]

Filming took place on two monochrome cameras, not many of which existed at the time. In the scenes with Bella in a car, a remote driver controlled steering from a pod on top of the car. This allowed Peake to act fearfully with more realism. At one point, a dog jumps through a van window and shoots the driver. This sequence was achieved by filming the glass being broken for real, then adding the dog and additional broken glass in post-production.[14]

Real Lidar scans were used to create the scenes shown from the dog's perspective.[10] Collins came up with the idea that in the scene where the dog escapes the car wreckage, the release of its limb would be similar to the action of a drill chuck. Collins noted that the dog is ""almost humanized"" by its movement and damaged arm and compared the dog's multifaceted limbs to Pin Art.[7]

The final scene shows a case full of teddy bears, which were yellow in real life but appear white in the episode.[9] Brooker originally considered a gadget such as a Game Boy instead of a teddy bear, but Slade insisted on ""something that you can touch, that you would hold to you, that would give you comfort"".[13] The teddy bears were intended by Slade to be the only ""soft and comforting"" element of the story.[9]

In May 2017, a Reddit post unofficially announced the names and directors of the six episodes in series 4 of Black Mirror.[15] The first trailer for the series was released by Netflix on 25 August 2017, and it contained the six episode titles.[16][17] In October 2017, Jones revealed that ""Metalhead"" was filmed in black and white.[18]

Beginning on 24 November 2017, Netflix published a series of posters and trailers for the fourth series of the show, referred to as the ""13 Days of Black Mirror"".[19] The poster for ""Metalhead"" was released on 2 December, and the episode's trailer was released on 3 December.[20][21] The trailer led one commentator to speculate that the episode could be the show's ""most disturbing episode yet"",[20] with another saying the trailer was ""enigmatic"".[21] The following day, Netflix published a trailer featuring an amalgamation of scenes from the fourth series, which announced that the series would be released on 29 December.[22]

""Metalhead"" has been described as genre fiction[23][24] and low concept.[25] Its tone is one of hopelessness.[26] The episode is ""pared-down and gimmick-free""[25] and has ""the most minimal plot in the series"".[27] The Ringer's Alison Herman wrote that it is the only episode that can not be read as an allegory.[10] Jacob Stolworthy of The Independent suggested that it is the scariest episode of Black Mirror,[28] while The Verge's Bryan Bishop and his wife were ""literally squirming"" while watching.[26] However, The Atlantic reviewer David Sims commented that it has little gore when compared with other one-person survival fiction.[23]

The episode has widely been described as a simplified version of The Terminator,[25][26][29] a 1984 film which—similar to ""Metalhead""—is ""about a human run ragged by an android's unceasing pursuit"".[30] It has also been compared to the ""adrenaline highs"" of Mad Max: Fury Road, a 2015 post-apocalyptic film which director George Miller wanted to shoot in black and white.[29] Comparisons have also been drawn with the 2016 Anohni album Hopelessness, which ""effectively communicates the cold horrors of drone warfare"",[29] and the Philip K. Dick short story ""Second Variety"".[30] Scott Huver of Variety noted that the episode is one of several monochrome works produced around the same time, with others including FX anthology series Feud, and ""Gotta Light?"" from the 2017 revival of Twin Peaks.[31] Tim Surette of TV Guide compared the episode's horror to past Black Mirror episodes ""Playtest"" and ""White Bear"".[13]

""Metalhead"" contains several Easter eggs—small details which refer to other Black Mirror episodes. A postcard and the letters ""TCKR"" on a truck refer to ""San Junipero"", while ""Callister"" appears on a computer screen in allusion to ""USS Callister"".[32][33] When Clarke hijacks a van at the beginning of the episode, text on the car screen refers to previous episodes, as well as containing the message ""WHY. did. you. bother. PAUSING. this. you. freak"".[34][35] The white teddy bears at the end of the episode have been read as a reference to ""White Bear"".[35]

The episode can be seen to explore the AI control problem: Ed Cumming of The Telegraph questioned how one could ""set limits on [the] ruthlessness"" of a robotic guard dog.[27] While watching the episode, Nick Harley of Den of Geek questioned whether the dogs were self-aware.[36] Another Den of Geek critic, Ryan Lambie, believed the dogs are not artificial intelligence, as their ""lack of empathy or emotional nuance"" is suggestive of ""cold, pre-programmed logic"".[37] Cultfix's Ryan Monty described the episode as a ""pressing statement"" on autonomous AI and drone warfare.[38] Bishop commented that ""Metalhead"" may have been conceived with Amazon in mind, particularly its use of drones to carry packages.[26] Before reaching the final twist, Harley suggested the episode could have been about health care in a world where medication is government-controlled and guarded by AI.[36]

Slade has stated that if there is a theme, it is ""how important it is to hold onto our humanity"".[12] Commenting on the teddy bears, Emily VanDerWerff said in Vox that the message may be that humans are ""ruthless in some contexts and quite stupid and soft in others"".[24] According to Scott Beggs of Nerdist, the episode implies ""toys and art are just as vital to survival as the other stuff at the bottom of Maslow's hierarchy"".[39] Digital Spy's Steve O'Brien thought the moral is that ""there's still room for a tender gesture"" in the post-apocalyptic world.[25] Bishop believed the story is about the ""loss of human innocence"" as a sacrifice for progress.[26] Monty said the episode was about the triumph of ""cold, calculated machine effectiveness"" over human nature.[38]

Reviewers have commented on early dialogue in the car, when Bella, Anthony and Clarke pass some pigsties. Bishop believed it is a metaphor for economic inequality.[26] VanDerWerff suggested the scene evokes predator and prey imagery, comparing it to George Orwell's dystopia Animal Farm.[24]

The episode has received mostly positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the episode has a score of 69% based on 26 reviews, with an average rating of 6.90 out of 10. The website's critics consensus reads: ""Though 'Metalhead' is the show's shortest installment, the bleakness of its plot and spareness of its thrills can often make it feel longer – though some may appreciate its claustrophobic beauty.""[40] A Cultfix review gave the episode a score of eight out of ten.[38] The episode received four out of five stars in Den of Geek[36] and three out of five stars in The Telegraph.[27] A reviewer for The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+ rating.[30] Stolworthy believed ""Metalhead"" is in the ""upper echelons"" of Black Mirror episodes,[28] while Adam Starkey of Metro summarised it as ""an interesting experiment and welcome palette cleanser"", though far from the best episode.[41] Beggs called the episode ""gorgeous but incredibly dull"".[39]

Reviewers have widely commented on the episode's 41-minute running time. Sims praised the storyline as ""taut"", writing that it didn't ""waste a moment"".[23] Stolworthy said the ""relentless"" plot makes the episode ""feel like the longest"" rather than the shortest Black Mirror episode,[28] and Monty believed its runtime makes it ""one of the most effective and skin-crawling"" episodes.[38] Bishop commented that it would have been ""untenable"" to make the episode longer[26] and Starkey called the episode's length a ""relief"" rather than a ""detriment"".[41] However, Cumming believed the episode's themes are not enough to sustain it for its running time.[27]

The episode's minimalism was praised by Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club for its ""clear and immediate stakes"" and threat which keeps the viewers interested. However, Handlen also claimed that the episode is limited by its simplicity,[30] and VanDerWerff criticised it as ""exactly the wrong balance between too much information and too little"".[24] Paste's Jacob Oller said that the episode ""meanders"", and criticised the plot devices as unoriginal.[42]

Stolworthy praised Peake's acting, saying that it ""elevates"" the episode and increases the viewer's fear of the dog.[28] Harley praised her performance for allowing the audience to empathise with her character immediately. Harley also complimented the poignancy of Bella's final scene.[36] Monty said that ""Peake showcases the absolute best of her abilities"", playing a character who is ""fittingly human and emphatic in her will to survive"".[38] Handlen praised her as ""easy to root for"", saying that Peake ""does a good job of finding new ways to be terrified, angry, triumphant, and depressed"".[30] Cumming wrote that the actor is ""never hard to watch"" but only has the chance to express degrees of terror.[27]

Bishop commented on the quick pace and wrote that the dog appears ""utterly grounded in reality"".[26] Sims praised that ""every glimpse of the empty moors in high-contrast black-and-white photography jumps out at the viewer"",[23] while Lambie commented positively on the ending's final landscape shots.[37] Harley noted the sparse use of music to create a feeling of dread.[36] Monty lauded the lack of exposition in the episode, believing it is the ""strongest aspect"" as the audience can make individual inferences about the backstory.[38] However, Beggs criticised that the lack of exposition makes it difficult to empathise with Bella.[39]

The ending of ""Metalhead"" reveals that the warehouse box contained teddy bears. Lambie suggested this is ""bleak humour"" from Brooker, and another example of the show's exploration of the worst outcomes of new technology.[37] Beggs said the ending was paradoxically both ""face-slappingly cheap"" and ""an outstanding, deeply humane subversion"" of apocalypse films.[39] Harley criticised the ending as laughable and not profound.[36] Sims criticised it as ""perhaps a little too cute""[23] and VanDerWerff called it ""nonsensical"", going on to write that it ""lands somewhere between affectionate exasperation for humanity's foibles and a sick joke"".[24] Starkey wrote that the viewer anticipates a revelation about the world or conflict which never comes.[41]

The dog's design has been praised: Cumming called it ""horribly believable"".[27] Lambie called the dog's first appearance in the warehouse  a ""superb introduction"", and praised the ""spiteful and unpredictable"" weapons used by the dog.[37] Handlen was impressed by the special effects team's dramatisation of ""what is essentially a box on legs"", commending the ""creepily real"" design of the dog.[30] Contrastingly, Oller found the dog's design and animation simplistic, commenting that it is ""not the imposing, minimalist murder machine it needs to be"". Oller found that the monochrome gave the scenery an ""especially unreal sheen"".[42]

"
Black Museum,"

""Black Museum"" is the sixth and final episode of the fourth series of anthology series Black Mirror. It was directed by Colm McCarthy and written by series creator Charlie Brooker, with one part adapted from a story by Penn Jillette. The episode premiered on Netflix, along with the rest of series four, on 29 December 2017. The episode is divided into three stories, told by Rolo Haynes (Douglas Hodge), the owner of a remote Black Museum. He tells the visitor Nish (Letitia Wright) about the backstories of exhibits, which involve his previous employment in experimental technologies.

""Black Museum"" was filmed over a month in Spain and Nevada, United States. A horror episode, its themes include race and technology. The set contained a large number of Easter eggs referencing previous works in the series. ""Black Museum"" was met with mixed critical reception: most reviewers found its storyline and characterisation poor and the final plot twist proved polarising. The episode generally received weak rankings by critics in comparison to other Black Mirror episodes. However, Wright received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination and a Black Reel Award nomination for her acting.

Nish (Letitia Wright) visits the remote Black Museum at a filling station. The proprietor, Rolo Haynes (Douglas Hodge), explains backstories to the museum's crime-related artefacts, starting with a hairnet device.

Rolo previously recruited people for experimental medical technology. In a flashback, Dr. Peter Dawson (Daniel Lapaine) agreed to test an implant that made him feel the physical sensations of the person wearing the hairnet. He learned the feeling of many conditions and was able to diagnose patients quickly. After experiencing a man dying, he became aroused by his patients' pain. Addicted to it, he started mutilating himself and murdered a homeless man, which caused him to fall into a coma.

In the present, the air conditioner is broken, so Nish offers Rolo water. Moving on to a toy monkey, Rolo describes how he convinced Jack (Aldis Hodge) to transfer his comatose wife Carrie's (Alexandra Roach) consciousness into part of his brain, so she could experience his physical sensations and communicate with him. Jack and Carrie became aggravated by their lack of privacy and agency, respectively. Rolo offered Jack an ability to ""pause"" Carrie. Months later, Jack unpaused her, and they eventually agreed for her to be unpaused on weekends only. Jack began dating Emily (Yasha Jackson), who wanted Carrie to be deleted. Rolo transferred Carrie to the toy monkey, which could feel sensations and say two phrases (""Monkey loves you"" and ""Monkey needs a hug""). Carrie and Jack's son Parker was soon bored by it. The monkey technology became illegal, so Rolo was fired.

The museum's centerpiece is a holographic Clayton Leigh (Babs Olusanmokun). Rolo insists he was guilty of murder but Nish reminds him of conflicting evidence. While on death row, Clayton signed up to Rolo's exhibit: when a visitor pulls a lever, a conscious hologram of Clayton receives the electric chair, and a souvenir copy of him experiencing electrocution is made. The exhibit was immensely popular. As Rolo begins to asphyxiate, Nish continues the story, revealing herself as Clayton's daughter. After public protests, attendance to the exhibit dwindled to sadists and wealthy white supremacists, who left Clayton's hologram in a vegetative state. His wife and Nish's mother Angelica (Amanda Warren) overdosed the day after she saw him. As revenge, Nish sabotaged the air conditioner and gave Rolo poisoned water. Nish transfers Rolo's consciousness into Clayton's hologram, then electrocutes it, which creates a souvenir of Rolo's suffering.

Nish takes the monkey containing Carrie with her and sets the museum on fire. She converses with her mother, whose consciousness is inside her head, like Carrie's was with Jack.

Whilst series one and two of Black Mirror were shown on Channel 4 in the UK, Netflix commissioned the programme for 12 episodes (split into two series of six episodes) in September 2015 with a bid of $40 million.[1][2] In March 2016, Netflix outbid Channel 4 for the right to distribute the series in the UK.[2] The six episodes in series four were released on Netflix simultaneously on 29 December 2017.[3] ""Black Museum"" is listed as the last episode, and was also one of the later episodes to be made. Production overlapped with various stages of each of the other five episodes' productions.[4][5]

The episode is a combination of three stories, the same structure as the 2014 special ""White Christmas"". Brooker described it as a narrative of ""punishment and racism"", similar to series two episode ""White Bear"", and with a tone resembling the 1990s American horror anthology series Tales from the Crypt. Some of the ideas used in ""Black Museum"" had been discussed prior to the production of series four. Brooker had conceived earlier of a ghost story involving a digital prisoner who was repeatedly electrocuted. Another unrelated idea was of people having other consciousnesses implanted in their brain, such as a person who had an ex-partner in their brain, or a person who rented out parts of their brain to dead people.[5]

The first part of the anthology, involving Dr. Peter Dawson, was based on the short story ""The Pain Addict"" authored by magician Penn Jillette early in his career.[6] Jillette had written the story based on the personal experience of being ill in a Spanish welfare hospital in 1981, where it was difficult to get a diagnosis due to the language barrier. He conceived of technology that allowed a doctor to understand what pain a person was suffering, but led to the doctor's addiction to the pain of others. The story continued with the doctor ""beating people to feel their pain"", engaging in sadomasochism and fantasising of masturbating while Jesus is crucified.[7] The idea was published as a short story in the 1988 anthology Would, Could, Should.[8][9] Jillette met with Brooker before the production of the third series and told him about the story.[7]

Around two years later, Brooker contacted Jillette to explain that he wanted to use ""The Pain Addict"" as a story in ""Black Museum"". Jillette then worked with Brooker on the framing story, which would involve a washed-up Las Vegas carny running the Black Museum outside of Vegas. Jillette wanted to audition for the role of the carny, but the production was too far along to change the casting.[7] Brooker took Jillette's past performances as part of Penn & Teller and his documentary series Bullshit! as inspiration for Rolo.[5]

The production had previously looked to cast Letitia Wright in an episode of the third series of Black Mirror, but she became unavailable. During casting for ""Black Museum"", Wright was at the end of shooting for the superhero film Black Panther, where she worked with the star of the first series episode ""Fifteen Million Merits"", Daniel Kaluuya. She provided a self-tape audition, with Kaluuya reading the other characters' lines. Filming took place immediately after Black Panther's filming ended.[5]

Douglas Hodge starred in the episode as Rolo Haynes, describing his character as a white supremacist and ""the most toxic person"" he had played. Hodge stayed largely in character during the filming process, staying away from Wright and choosing not to rehearse lines off-screen.[5] Daniel Lapaine appears in this episode as Dr. Peter Dawson, after playing an unrelated role in the series one episode ""The Entire History of You"".[10]

Colm McCarthy directed the episode. It took a month to film, with locations including Spain and Nevada, United States.[11][12] Hodge's scenes were shot in chronological order. During the first story, Rolo shows Dr. Dawson a pair of rats, for which stuffed frozen rats were used. The second story featured a graphic sex scene, which took a long time to film relative to its brief screentime. Scenes which relate to the plot twist of Nish's true intentions at the museum—such as her first sighting of the museum, her handing Rolo water and her entering the exhibit where her father is—were shot in many different ways. Wright played the early scenes as if Nish was the tourist she claims to be.[5]

Brooker and executive producer Annabel Jones participated in the edit of the episode, aiming to find a more human side to Rolo's character at certain points, and omitting some of the darker moments.[5]

The music for the episode was composed by Cristobal Tapia de Veer, who commented on the score: ""The beginning, discovering the Black Museum, that was going to set the tone for the rest of the show. The music morphed in many ways throughout the three stories, then goes back to where it started with the Black Museum, although with a sense of accomplishment, but also a sense of doom.""[13]

In May 2017, a Reddit post unofficially announced the names of the six episodes in series 4 of Black Mirror.[14] The first trailer for the series was released by Netflix on 25 August 2017.[15][16] Beginning on 24 November 2017, Netflix published a series of posters and trailers for the fourth series of the show, referred to as the ""13 Days of Black Mirror"".[17] The poster for ""Black Museum"" was released on 28 November and the trailer on 29 November.[18][19] On 6 December Netflix published a trailer featuring an amalgamation of scenes from the fourth series, which announced that the series would be released on 29 December.[20]

Cristobal Tapia de Veer's compositions for the episode were released through Lakeshore Records on 19 January 2018.[21] A music sampler was released earlier, on 27 December 2017, on his YouTube and SoundCloud accounts.[22][23]

Sophie Gilbert of The Atlantic found that the episode's structure was very similar to the previous portmanteau instalment ""White Christmas"".[24] ""Black Museum"" has a linear narrative and Jacob Oller of Paste believed that the three stories are ""darker and darker"" as they progress.[25][26] Tasha Robinson of The Verge commented that it explores the genre of ""traditional horror"".[25][27] Louise Mellor of Den of Geek found it the ""most cynical episode of the season"".[28] Robinson said that the ""storytelling style"" is as in previous instalments, but not the ""moral framework"": rather than the notion that ""people are terrible"" or ""technology is dangerous"", it revolves around Rolo being ""personally loathsome"".[27] Mellor commented that the first story is ""physically horrid"", the second ""wickedly cruel"" and the third a ""sad story"" with ""no laughs"".[28] Reviewing the stories' tones, Robinson found the first to be ""dim and claustrophobic"", the second ""naturalistic"" and the last ""shot with a grind house seediness"".[27]

The episode was compared by Robinson to the 1990s horror anthology series Tales from the Crypt, with Rolo Haynes in a role similar to the cryptkeeper.[27] Christopher Hooton of The Independent compared its racial themes to the 2017 horror film Get Out.[29] The technology allowing Dr. Peter Dawson to experience other people's physical sensations was compared by Charles Bramesco of Vulture to the 19th century novella The Corsican Brothers, about a pair of formerly conjoined twins who can feel the other's pain.[30] Gabriel Tate of The Telegraph found the consciousness transfer into a person's brain to be similar to the comic strip series The Numskulls, where small beings maintain the characters' brains and bodies.[31] Mellor found the use of ""(There's) Always Something There to Remind Me"" in the ending to be a punchline characteristic of Black Mirror's fourth series.[28]

Rolo Haynes is a ""stand-in narrator"", according to Steve Green of IndieWire.[32] Bramesco called him a ""storyteller"" with a role similar to Matt Trent in ""White Christmas"".[30] Jason Parham of Wired found him to be ""an opportunistic sociopath"" like the 19th century circus owner P. T. Barnum.[25] Noel Ransome called Rolo ""a figure of the white and the western, who senselessly use the black and the misguided for personal gain"".[33] The ending saw Rolo the victim of the technology he had created, similar to Robert Daly's outcome in series four episode ""USS Callister"".[30] Convicted murderer Clayton Leigh's innocence was disputed by critics,[34] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club finding him innocent but Tate believing it to be ambiguous.[31][35] Ransome wrote that he serves as ""the standard black man"", who ""begins with enthusiasm and ends with exhaustion"".[33] The ending can be interpreted as happy, with Rolo getting what he deserved.[35] Bramesco found that the programme ""doesn't condemn"" Nish, only the ""ugly racism"" of Rolo.[30] Parham found the story to be about ""cruelty of the prison system"" and saw Nish freeing her father as a symbolic act.[25] Greene called Nish's actions ""an act of mercy"" to Clayton.[32]

The episode includes Easter egg references to each of the 18 previous Black Mirror episodes, according to McCarthy; many were placed by set designer Joel Collins.[11] Gilbert said that this ""seemed to definitively tie the Black Mirror universe together"".[24] Collins said that he wanted to make the set a ""hidden celebration of six years of Black Mirror"".[5] For example, Jack is seen reading a comic showing plot points from ""Fifteen Million Merits"", and the museum's entrance includes a screen showing a picture of Victoria Skillane, a mannequin with a black balaclava and a white two-pronged symbol—all from ""White Bear"". The two rats shown to Dawson by Haynes are named Kenny and Hector, referencing the main characters from ""Shut Up and Dance"". The episode also makes multiple allusions to ""San Junipero"", including the company TCKR, a hospital named Saint Juniper's and Yorkie and Kelly's dresses being on display in the museum.[11][36]

The term ""Black Museum"" was the original name for the Crime Museum, a museum of crime artefacts at Scotland Yard in the United Kingdom.[24] Greene believed the museum served as an analogy to the series, which is about ""finding addictive entertainment value in the plight of removed dystopias"".[32] Many museum items are taken from previous episodes, for instance: an autonomous drone insect (ADI) from ""Hated in the Nation""; the lollipop Daly uses to clone Walton's son in ""USS Callister""; the tablet used by Marie in ""Arkangel""; and the bloodied bathtub where Shazia's husband was murdered in ""Crocodile"".[11][36] Separately, one wall of the museum includes a number of death masks, which are busts of crew members.[37]

""Black Museum"" received a mixed critical reception.[33] On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 75%, based on 28 reviews. The website's critics consensus reads: ""Black Mirror goes full Black Mirror in 'Black Museum', an anthology within the anthology that has hits, misses, and plenty of philosophical sinew to chew on.""[38] It received ratings of three out of five stars in The Telegraph, a C+ in The A.V. Club and a C− in Entertainment Weekly.[31][35][39] Sonia Saraiya of Variety called it the ""worst episode"" of the series, Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly finding it the ""only outright stinker"".[39][40] Handlen reviewed that its ""obvious setups"" led to the work lacking ""surprise or insight"", while Tate found that the characters were not developed well.[31][35] Robinson reviewed that despite themes of punitive justice and racism, the commentary was ""too vague"".[27] Contrastingly, Ransome found it the ""most satisfying"" instalment of the series, commenting that many reviewers ""all seemed blind to the episode's overarching thesis on race"".[33] Hooton opined that it was ""very strong"".[29]

Franich criticised that the episode's three stories are only ""vaguely connected"", Caroline Framke of Vox finding that ""none particularly stand out"".[34][39] Saraiya believed that the narrative requires ""people repeatedly choosing to be stupid and/or evil"".[40] Handlen called the stories ""mean-spirited"".[35] However, Hooton called the stories ""engrossing"".[29] Tate found the first to be ""competent if predictable"", though Gilbert reviewed that the homeless man's murder was ""one of the most gratuitously violent scenes"" in the show.[24][31] Tate found the second story the best, though Framke thought it ""not especially convincing"" and Bramesco believing Jack to be the ""dumbest man in history"" for agreeing to the consciousness transfer into his head.[30][31][34]

The final story and ending received mixed reception. Bramesco found that it ""doesn't make a whole lot of sense in terms of storytelling"" and Rebecca Nicholson of The Guardian thought it repeated previous themes of the series.[30][41] Gilbert said it ""isn't exactly a satisfying conclusion""; on the other hand, Framke called it ""incredibly satisfying"".[24][34] Mellor found the twist to be ""great"" and ""satisfying"", though Tate thought only the reveal that Nish's mother's consciousness was inside her head was ""genuinely unexpected"".[28][31] Framke called the third story overall ""deeply cruel and entirely believable"".[34] Mellor commented that the ending was ""happy"" and ""optimistic"" and sees ""justice done"".[28]

McCarthy's role as director was praised by Tate, who said that he ""directs with imagination throughout"".[31] Oller approved of the episode's ""clever visual effects"" and use of props.[26] The acting received mixed reception, Tate calling them ""serviceable although seldom spectacular.""[31] Mellor found that Wright and Hodges offered ""two excellent performances"", with Gilbert finding Wright the ""most compelling"".[24][28] Oller thought that the dialogue was ""clunky"" in places.[26]

""Black Museum"" received largely poor rankings on critics' lists of the 23 instalments of Black Mirror, from best to worst:



Instead of by quality, Proma Khosla of Mashable ranked the episodes by tone, concluding that ""Black Museum"" is the 7th-most pessimistic episode of the show.[50]
