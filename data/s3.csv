Nosedive,"

""Nosedive"" is the first episode in the third series of the British science fiction anthology series Black Mirror. Michael Schur and Rashida Jones wrote the teleplay for the episode, based on a story by series creator and co-showrunner Charlie Brooker, while Joe Wright acted as director. It premiered on Netflix on 21 October 2016, alongside the rest of the third series. The episode is set in a world where people can rate each other from one to five stars for every interaction they have, which can impact their socioeconomic status. Lacie (Bryce Dallas Howard) is a young woman overly obsessed with her ratings; she finds an opportunity to elevate her ratings greatly and move into a more luxurious residence after being chosen by her popular childhood friend (Alice Eve) as the maid of honour for her wedding.

Under Netflix, the episode was given a much larger budget than the previous episodes of the programme, when it had been under Channel 4. Brooker wrote an outline for the episode, then Schur wrote the first half of the episode and Jones wrote the latter. Production was undertaken in a manner similar to a short film; ""Nosedive"" was filmed in South Africa, with Seamus McGarvey as director of photography and Joel Collins and James Foster as the production designers. The tone of the episode is less bleak and more comedic than other Black Mirror episodes, with the ending significantly more positive than in episodes of the programme's prior two series.

The episode received mainly positive reviews and is middling in critics' lists of Black Mirror episodes, qualitatively. The pastel visual aesthetics were widely praised, along with Max Richter's soundtrack and Howard's performance. A criticism from several reviewers was the episode's predictability and ending, though the script and comedic undertones were praised by some. Many critics noted the similarity of the episode to real-world app Peeple and China's Social Credit System, along with fictional works about social media with themes of gender and obsession with image. The episode won a Royal Television Society Craft & Design Award. It was nominated for several awards, including a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for Howard and a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for McGarvey. A board game Nosedive, based on the episode, was released in 2018.

Society has embraced a technology wherein everyone shares their daily activities through eye implants and mobile devices where one rates their interactions with others on a scale from one to five stars, cumulatively affecting everyone's socioeconomic status.

Lacie Pound (Bryce Dallas Howard) seeks to raise her 4.2 rating to 4.5 for a discount on a luxury apartment; however, despite her attempts to be outgoing and pleasant, her rating has plateaued. Lacie talks to a consultant who suggests gaining favour from very highly rated people. Lacie uploads a photograph of Mr. Rags, a ragdoll that she and her childhood friend Naomi (Alice Eve) made together. Naomi, who is currently rated 4.8, rates the photo five stars and calls Lacie to announce her engagement, inviting Lacie to deliver a wedding speech as the maid of honour. Lacie agrees and commits on the apartment, anticipating many high ratings from the guests.

On the day of her flight, several mishaps cause people to rate Lacie negatively, dropping her rating below 4.2. At the airport, her flight is cancelled and she cannot buy a seat on an alternate flight with her current rating. When Lacie causes a scene, security penalises her by putting her on ""double damage"" and subtracting a full point for 24 hours. Because of her low rating, Lacie can only rent an older car to drive to the wedding, which she cannot recharge when it runs out of power. She is forced to hitchhike with Susan (Cherry Jones), a truck driver with a rating of 1.4. Susan tells Lacie that she used to care about her rating until her late husband was passed over for vital cancer treatment because their scores were deemed not high enough. Susan says she is much freer without obsessing over ratings.

While Lacie is en route to the wedding, Naomi tells her to not come, as her severely reduced rating will negatively impact Naomi's own ratings. Enraged, Lacie reaches the wedding and sneaks in during the reception. She grabs the microphone and starts giving the speech she had written but insults Naomi with references to childhood conflict, finally grabbing a knife and threatening to behead Mr. Rags. The guests rate Lacie negatively, causing her rating to drop below one star. Lacie is imprisoned with her eye implants removed. She and the man in the cell opposite hers (Sope Dirisu) realise they can now speak without worrying about being rated, and gleefully hurl insults at each other.

""Nosedive"" is the first episode of the third series of Black Mirror; all six episodes in this series were released on Netflix simultaneously on 21 October 2016. Brooker says it was selected to be the season premiere ""partly to slightly ease people in"",[1] at Netflix's recommendation.[2] Alongside ""San Junipero"", ""Nosedive"" was first shown in 2016 ahead of its Netflix release at the Toronto International Film Festival.[3] Two days prior to the series' release on Netflix, Brooker hinted that ""Nosedive"" is ""a pastel, playful satire about modern insecurity.""[4]

Whilst series one and two of Black Mirror were shown on Channel 4 in the UK, in September 2015 Netflix commissioned the series for 12 episodes (split into two series of six episodes),[5] and in March 2016 it outbid Channel 4 for the rights to distributing the third series, with a bid of $40 million.[6] Due to its move to Netflix, the show had a larger budget than in previous series,[7] which one critic suggests is responsible for the ""impressive line-up"" that was noted by many reviewers.[8] Another critic called this episode the show's ""most ambitious yet"";[9] due to its larger episode order, series 3 was also able to vary its genre and tone more than previous series.[10] One reviewer also noted that ""Nosedive"" contained ""only American characters"".[3]

In November 2016, to tie in with the episode, Netflix released a tongue-in-cheek app called Rate Me. The app allows users to rate people, by their Twitter handle, and view their own rating and the ratings of others.[11]

The episode is based on an idea by series creator Charlie Brooker for a movie; he and executive producer Annabel Jones pitched the idea to several movie companies in the United States after the first series of Black Mirror, but it was not commissioned.[2] The original idea was of a comedy similar to Brewster's Millions, focused on a high status person trying to reduce their ranking in 24 hours.[2][12] Later, Brooker wrote either a three[13] or four[14] page outline for the episode, wanting it to be ""comedic, darkly"".[13] This version took inspiration from 1987 film Planes, Trains and Automobiles, in which the character is on a journeyâ€”for ""Nosedive"", this was initially a character travelling to an important work presentation.[2]

Rashida Jones and Michael Schur wrote the episode. Known for comedy and sitcoms, the pair had previously worked together on many shows, including Parks and Recreation, but had never written anything together before ""Nosedive"".[14] A fan of Brooker's works, Rashida Jones had been in contact with him for a few years beforehand and after the programme's move to Netflix, he suggested that she could write an episode. Schur was also a fan of Black Mirror and Rashida Jones suggested that they could co-write the episode. With Jones and Schur on board, the main character changed from someone focused on playing the ratings system to a people-pleaser, the work presentation was changed to a wedding and the idea of Lacie having a childhood talisman was introduced. Lacie's brother was originally an ex-boyfriend.[2]

Schur wrote the first half of the episode (up to Lacie beginning her travel in a rented car), while Rashida Jones wrote the second half, and the two then combined their scripts.[14] In the initial draft, the episode ended with Lacie's work presentation going viral and her achieving fame. The final version of the ending showed Lacie in a jail cell, the rating device removed from her, allowing her to find freedom. An unused idea was that of rage rooms, where characters would go to destroy things to let out their anger.[2]

In 2016, Schur had an account on Twitter but not Facebook or Instagram, as ""there's a bunch of strangers talking shit about you in there"", and Jones expressed a similarly negative attitude, stating ""I do have very strong, very conflicted feelings about rating systems and social media.""[14] Brooker notes that ""you are rewarded for having a more extreme opinion"" on social media; in the episode, as on the internet, almost all ratings given are either one or five stars.[15] Similarly, Schur opines that social media causes people to exaggerate their behaviour, particularly their rudeness.[16]

Jones believes that the episode, as with all Black Mirror episodes, ""pushes you into the near future"", while Schur considers it to be more of a ""parallel reality"". Brooker has described the episode as ""like a cross between Pleasantville and The Truman Show"".[13] Jones says the belief that ""women are taught to be liked, and men are taught to be powerful"", credited to Sheryl Sandberg, is relevant to the episode, with Schur agreeing that Lacie's gender is important to the story,[15] though Schur notes that edited images on social media are causing negative body image issues for men as well.[16]

The episode was the third in series three to be filmed.[2] Joe Wright directed the episode, Seamus McGarvey was director of photography and the production designers, working for VFX company Painting Practice, were Joel Collins[17] and James Foster.[18] The episode was shot in four weeks[19] in Knysna, South Africa,[2] a coastal town five hours (by car) from Cape Town chosen as it felt like an American coastal town.[17][2] Series three episode ""San Junipero"" was also filmed in South Africa.[17]

In an interview with Variety, McGarvey noted that the episode was shot in 4K resolution at the request of Netflix. He said the colour scheme was a mixture of duck-egg blue, ""peppermint green"" and ""strange peach colors"", and that props and ""even the drinks people are drinking"" were chosen with care to create a ""sickly pastel feel"".[19] Wright said that he made almost no changes to the script's dialogue.[20] Brooker has said that Wright's pastel treatment was a ""very strong visual idea that we had not foreseen"".[21]

Brooker pointed out that directors of Black Mirror episodes (in this case, Wright) have more ""power"" than in serialised television shows, as ""it is like making a short film"", and he said that Wright had ""been feeling quite bruised after doing Pan, and [Black Mirror] was a good thing for him to get his teeth into which wasn't the full five-year commitment of a movie"".[1] McGarvey had previously worked with Wright.[19] Watching rushes from the filming, Brooker was initially sceptical about Wright's saccharine style, but began to understand it as the filming progressed and the music was added.[21] The scenes in which Lacie is driving utilise a computer-generated landscape designed by Dan May, the episode's art director.[17] She was initially planned to drive through multiple landscapes such as a desert, but this was changed for budget reasons.[2]

Bryce Dallas Howard plays Lacie, the episode's main character. She was suggested by Wright, who auditioned her a decade previously for Atonement.[20] Howard gained 30 pounds (14Â kg) for the role, saying in an interview with Marie Claire that body shaming is a ""huge part of the subtext of the story"".[22] She chose a laugh for Lacie which mixed ""fear"", ""disingenuousness"" and ""depression"".[2] Howard first joined social media during Thanksgiving 2015 and was approached with the treatment of the episode a fortnight later, in December 2015.[22][23]

Chosen by Wright to compose the episode's soundtrack,[21] Max Richter is a self-described ""conservatoire, university-trained classical composer"".[24] Richter first met the director, Joe Wright, in London before the shooting of the episode had been completed and began coming up with ideas for the score. Richter aimed to ""support"" the episode's display of ""incredible anxiety hovering beneath this smiley surface ... while at the same time not flattening out the emotionality of it"", commenting in an interview that Wright's camerawork had a ""dream-like quality"" and that Brooker's ""story was fantastic"".[25]

In another interview, Richter said he was aiming for the episode to have ""warmth and a fairytale quality throughout"" with ""darkness underneath it"", and notes that his composition was based on ""the sentiment and the emotional trajectory of the characters"". Richter also composed the sound effects which play when one character rates another, and incorporated these sounds into the score itself.[24]

Several critics compared the episode to a 2014 episode of Community, ""App Development and Condiments"", which features an app where users assign each other ""Meow Meow Beenz"" ratings on a scale from one to five; Jack Shepherd of The Independent notes that both episodes ""critically [analyse] people's obsession with stature on social media platforms with rating systems"".[9] Other reviewers compared ""Nosedive"" to the mobile application Peeple,[26] in which users could rate one another, that garnered immediate backlash upon its release.[26][12] Brooker said in an interview that he was not aware of the Community episode when he came up with the idea for ""Nosedive"", but that he did see advertising for Peeple during pre-production, initially thinking it would turn out to be marketing for a comedy show, and he considered whether or not they should still produce the episode.[12] The episode has also been compared to the 2003 novel Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom, as each work explores a link between social approval and power.[27]

Manuel Betancourt of Pacific Standard explains how ""Nosedive"" fits with other portrayals of social media in television and film, comparing it to 2017 films The Circle and Ingrid Goes West, which both explore negative aspects of social media. Betancourt says that historically, women have been portrayed as victims of technology, a pattern which these works fit. For instance, Ingrid and Lacie are both obsessed with coming across as perfect online. In contrast, male characters are traditionally the voice of reason: in these works, Lacie's brother Ryan, Mercer (The Circle) and Taylor's husband (Ingrid Goes West) serve this purpose.[28] The androgyny of ""Nosedive"" character Susan is linked to her disdain for social media.[29] Betancourt writes that these characterisations do not accord with research on how men and women use technology, where some studies report that men have more emotional investment in positive feedback on social media. However, ""Nosedive"" shows people of all genders placing importance in social media, leading Betancourt to call it ""perhaps the most keen-eyed critique [...] of recent titles"".[28]

A Business Insider article by Erin Brodwin notes that the episode shows Lacie fall victim to the hedonic treadmill. Despite momentary happiness when receiving a high rating, Lacie is ""lonely and unsatisfied"". Brodwin points out that scientific studies concur with Lacie's experience, because there is no correlation between using social media and being happy in the long-term.[30]

Critics have also noted the inclusion of Easter eggs within Black MirrorÂ â€“ small details referring to other episodes. In ""Nosedive"", there is a frame where a social media post from Michael Callow reads, ""Just got thrown out of the zoo againÂ :("", a joke based on Callow having intercourse with a pig in ""The National Anthem"".[31] Brooker has described this Easter egg as his favourite in series three.[32] Another reference to that episode is the fictional show Sea of Tranquility; in ""The National Anthem"", a special effects expert mentions having worked on the show, while in ""Nosedive"", Lacie hitchhikes with fans of the show. Additionally, in ""Hated in the Nation"", a news ticker contains the term ""Reputelligent"", which is the name of the company that Lacie consults for advice about her rating.[33]

""Nosedive"" has been widely compared to China's Social Credit System, a government initiative which began pilot projects in 2014,[34] initially using private systems such as Sesame Credit.[35][36] The state projects were implemented differently by local governments, but each collected data on citizens in order to assign them an overall score.[34] An example plan saw the scores determine whether a citizen would be allowed to take out a loan or what quality of school their child would go to. Actions such as defaulting on a loan or being critical of the government would decrease a person's score. By the time ""Nosedive"" was released, the Sesame Credit system, which assigned users scores between 350 and 950,[37] allowed some people with high scores to rent vehicles without a deposit, or pay to skip hospital queues.[35][38] Furthermore, a person's score in Sesame Credit was dependent on the scores of the people in their social circle.[37]

The proposed and existing systems have been widely compared to the episode as a whole. Specifically, it has been noted that the apartment discount Lacie hopes for is similar to how high-rated people under Sesame Credit could rent cars without a deposit.[39] Additionally, Lacie's ejection from the airport is reminiscent of the system's control over who can partake in some forms of transport.[40]

Series creator Charlie Brooker has commented on numerous occasions about links between the episode and the Social Credit System. He joked in an interview, ""I promise you we didn't sell the idea to the Chinese government!"" About seeing the concept of the episode come to life in the real world, Brooker said, ""It was quite trippy"".[41] He comments that a key difference between China's plans and the one in ""Nosedive"" is ""that there's a central government assessing things. Being state-controlled, it feels even more sinister"", and also points out that the Social Credit System ""sounds like an attempt to make the population behave in a particular way"".[42] In November 2016, the Facebook page for Black Mirror shared an article in The Washington Post about the Social Credit System.[note 1]

Adam Mosseri, the CEO of social network Instagram, said he was inspired by ""Nosedive"" to test the hiding of ""likes"" on the Instagram service starting in 2019, recognising the negative connotations that keeping the number of ""likes"" easily visible had on some users' behaviour.[43]

The episode was parodied in the 2017 Saturday Night Live sketch ""Five Stars"". It features Aziz Ansari and Bobby Moynihan desperately trying to impress each other on an Uber ride to boost each other's ratings. The sketch explicitly mentions Black Mirror, with both characters saying that ""San Junipero"" is their favourite episode.[44][45]

Behind her pink and perky faÃ§ade, Lacie becomes obsessed with social media status in ""Nosedive"", an episode that demonstrates the dangers of society's need for approval but does so with a perfect dose of humor.

â€“Critics' consensus on Rotten Tomatoes[46]

""Nosedive"" was well received by critics. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes collected 22 reviews, identified 95% of them as positive, and calculated an average rating of 7.33/10.[46] The episode garnered four-star ratings in The Independent and The Guardian,[47][7] along with an Aâˆ’ rating in The A.V. Club.[48] In The Mancunion, the episode received 3.5 stars;[49] it was rated three stars by The Telegraph and the Irish Independent.[8][50] Emefa Setranah of The Mancunion writes that the episode lives up to the show's reputation,[49] and The Guardian's Benjamin Lee says the episode feels fresh despite covering technology similarly to prior episodes.[7]

Charles Bramesco writes in Vulture that it expresses the show's ""guiding theme"" with ""lucid clarity"".[51] TheWrap authors praise how the episode tackles society's social media obsession,[52] and Mat Elfring of GameSpot opines that its thought-provoking nature makes it a good choice for the season premiere.[53] Matt Fowler writes for IGN that the episode is ""both fun and frustrating"" which contrasts with the ""grounded and grim"" episodes to follow.[54] Esquire's Corey Atad opines that it is ""a tad too simplistic"" though ""totally engaging"".[55] Pat Stacey criticises the episode in the Irish Independent that it ""sets up the premise crisply, then spends far too much time labouring the point.""[50]

A major criticism among reviewers was the episode's predictability and repetitiveness,[49][56] while reception to the ending was mixed. Aubrey Page on Collider calls the episode ""woefully surface-level and a bit off-brand"" because of its predictability,[57] with Variety's Andrew Wallenstein agreeing and further saying that the episode lacks a disturbing tone, though this makes it more accessible.[58] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club believes that the first half of ""Nosedive"" is too predictable but the second half ""[adds] depth and sincerity"".[48] Tasha Robinson writes for The Verge that the episode ""can be strident and obvious"" but ""understands human nature very well"".[27] Some reviewers believed the episode was too long and the ending was too positive.[26][48] However, Digital Spy's Alex Mullane praised the ending, because though it is ""bleak in some ways"" it is also ""a moment of sheer, fist-pumping joy"";[59] Jacob Hall agrees on /Film, calling the ending ""simultaneously cathartic and on-the-nose"".[60]

Critics had a mostly positive response to the script as a whole, with some noting comedic undertones.[61] Robinson describes the episode as an ""exaggerated morality play about the dangers of conformity and the small pleasures of individuality"".[27] The script has been called ""bitingly hilarious"",[3] ""funny"", ""uplifting"",[59] ""moving"" and ""supremely unsettling"".[51] Lee approves of the script avoiding exposition.[7] On the other hand, The Telegraph's Mark Monahan criticises that the plot and characters do not live up to their potential.[8] Page feels the episode ""lacks the sadistic snap of Brooker's usual work"".[57]

The episode's visual style and Joe Wright's directing were highly commended;[47] the setting for the episode garnered positive reception.[3][7][8] Hall compliments ""stellar production values"".[60] Sophie Gilbert of The Atlantic praises the juxtaposition of calm visuals with narrative tension.[26] Robinson notes that the aesthetics mark a difference between the characters with high and low ratings.[27] Adam Chitwood comments for Collider that the visual style ""keeps everything focused on the characters"", which is different to Joe Wright's typical style.[3] Setranah notes that Netflix's large budget is apparent in the visuals of the episode,[49] and The Independent writers suggest it is detailed enough to be revisited.[62]

Many critics praised Howard's performance,[48][49] with Atad calling it ""delightfully unhinged"".[55] Additionally, Gilbert writes that Howard ""conveys Lacie's inner frustration while grinning cheerfully through it"".[26] Howard's acting ensures viewers are on Lacie's side, according to Mullane, who also compliments Eve's acting as ""excellent"".[59]

Max Richter's musical composition for the episode was well received. The Independent writers compliment Richter for ""blending the diegetic sounds of the app with the non-diegetic score evoking our protagonist's struggle to determine reality and fiction"",[47] an element which Robinson also praises.[27] Fowler calls the score ""very compelling""[54] and Monahan describes it as ""elegantly elegiac"".[8]

Julien Migozzi found similarities between the episode and the segregation that South Africans suffer under credit score systems.[63]

""Nosedive"" appears on many critics' rankings of the 19 episodes in Black Mirror, from best to worst.



Instead of by quality, Proma Khosla of Mashable ranked each episode by tone, concluding that ""Nosedive"" is the 15th most pessimistic of the 19 episodes.[68]

Other critics ranked the 13 episodes in Black Mirror's first three series.



Some critics ranked the six episodes from series three of Black Mirror in order of quality.

""Nosedive"" was nominated for several awards in 2017; the third season of Black Mirror also received several other nominations and awards.

Based on the episode, the board game Nosedive was produced by Asmodee. Released on 25 November 2018, the game requires between three and six players and is designed to last for roughly 45 minutes.[78] A mobile app, available for Android or iOS, is used to play the game; it initially assigns each player a Social Score. In the initial Lifestyle phase, players draw cards which have ratings between one and five stars, such as the one star card ""A six-minute lunch break"". They tactically assign them to stacks and then each player selects a stack.[79]

In the Experience phase, players assign each other experiences such as ""Receiving an anonymous hate cake"" and each player then rates their received experiences from one to five stars. The app then adjusts each player's Social Score based on these ratings. At the end of the game, players earn points from the Lifestyle cards they own which have star ratings less than or equal to their Social Score.[79]

Tasha Robinson of The Verge criticised the game's mechanics as feeling arbitrary, as users' Social Scores are mostly determined by random factors. However, Robinson praised the app's design, the game's pastel aesthetics and the humour of the Experience cards, which can lead to interesting discussion.[79]
"
Playtest,"

""Playtest"" is the second episode in the third series of the British science fiction anthology television series Black Mirror. Written by series creator and showrunner Charlie Brooker and directed by Dan Trachtenberg, it premiered on Netflix on 21 October 2016, with the rest of series three.

The episode follows Cooper (Wyatt Russell), an American who playtests an upcoming augmented reality game in London while travelling. It is a horror game which accesses his brain and targets his fears. Hannah John-Kamen co-stars as a video game journalist Cooper meets. The episode was inspired by an idea Brooker had for an augmented reality Whac-A-Mole game which increased in speed until the subject went crazy. After considering Tokyo, the crew decided to shoot in London.

A work of psychological horror, the episode features numerous video game references and many instances of foreshadowing. The episode received mixed critical reception, with criticisms of the storyline and ending but praise given to Trachtenberg's directing and Russell's acting. The episode was nominated for a British Academy Television Craft Award, an RTS Craft & Design Award and a Visual Effects Society Award.

After his father dies from Alzheimer's disease, Cooper (Wyatt Russell) travels the world, ignoring phone calls from his mother. In London, he spends a night with the technology journalist Sonja (Hannah John-Kamen). He is forced to stay with her after his bank account is drained when he becomes victim to identity theft, but finds a paid offer to playtest a game for SaitoGemu.

At the company's building, he is met by Katie (Wunmi Mosaku) in an experiment room. Though she turns his phone off, he turns it back on to surreptitiously take pictures of the test kit for Sonja. Katie implants a small device called a ""mushroom"" in the back of his neck. He tests an augmented reality version of the game Whac-A-Mole. Cooper is impressed and agrees to a further test. He meets with Shou (Ken Yamamura), the company's owner, and is told that he will experience a horror game where an artificial neural network personalises the experience to his fears.

At Harlech House, the mansion he recognises from a SaitoGemu game, Cooper has an earpiece to communicate with Katie; there are also cameras throughout. After a while, he sees a spider and then a figure appearing in a painting. He hears footsteps and sees a simulation of Josh Peters (Jamie Paul), his childhood bully. In the kitchen, an enormous spider with Peters' face appears. Cooper's earpiece then ceases to work. Sonja arrives and urges Cooper to leave, but Cooper finds inconsistencies in her story. She stabs him and they fight. As her face inverts to a red skull, Cooper impales her on the knife lodged through his shoulder, and she, the knife, and Cooper's injury disappear.

As earpiece communication resumes, Katie leads Cooper to an upstairs room to terminate the test. Katie begins interrogating Cooper as he forgets details about his mother and then himself. After attempting to remove the mushroom with a shard of glass, Katie and Shou burst in and restrain him, saying that the technology has advanced too far to be removed.

Cooper awakens in Shou's office, the experiment having lasted only a single second and nothing subsequent having been real. Cooper returns home to find his mother (Elizabeth Moynihan), who does not recognise him, dialling his number repeatedly. Back in the first experiment room, Cooper yells for his mother as the mushroom kills him. Cooper was in fact killed within 0.04 seconds by a phone call from his mother causing signal interference with the device, the subsequent experience existing only in his head.

Whilst series one and two of Black Mirror were shown on Channel 4 in the UK, in September 2015 Netflix commissioned the series for twelve episodes (split into two series of six episodes).[1] In March 2016, Netflix outbid Channel 4 for the rights to distributing the third series, with an offer of $40 million.[2] Due to its move to Netflix, the show had a larger budget than in previous series.[3] ""Playtest"" is the second episode of the third series;[4] all six episodes in the series were released on Netflix simultaneously on 21 October 2016. As Black Mirror is an anthology series, each installment is standalone.[5] ""Playtest"" was placed second partly because Halloween was soon after the release date,[5] though series creator Charlie Brooker commented that maybe it should not have been second as it is a ""romp"" rather than a ""message episode"".[6]

The titles of the six episodes that make up the third series were announced in July 2016, along with the release date.[7] A trailer for series three, featuring an amalgamation of clips and sound bites from the six episodes, was released by Netflix on 7 October 2016.[8] ""Playtest"" was screened at the New York Comic Con in early October 2016.[9]

The first treatment of ""Playtest"" was written by Brooker, after which he worked on producing and refining a script with the director Dan Trachtenberg.[10] Conceptually, Brooker was inspired with an idea where a person is given augmented reality implants to play a virtual Whac-A-Mole game which becomes repeatedly faster, causing the person to go crazy and be placed with numerous other subjects all traumatised by moles. However, this only proved to be enough material for a fifteen-minute episode.[11] Brooker then conceived of adding a haunted house concept, where the augmented reality technology would dynamically change what the person saw in response to their fears.[11]

Trachtenberg was introduced to the project around the time of his directorial debut in the horror film 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016).[12] Brooker said that Trachtenberg was ""adamant"" that the story should be ""one step ahead"" of what viewers expect.[6] Once they were working together, Trachtenberg and Brooker discovered that they had both previously been employed as video game journalistsâ€”Brooker for PC Zone and Trachtenberg for The Totally Rad Show.[12][13] The extra twist at the end of the episodeâ€”in which Cooper is killed by his phone ringingâ€”was not in the original treatment, but added later. Brooker commented that it was partly inspired by Daniel Mallory Ortberg, who wrote in an article: ""Next on Black Mirror: what if phones, but too much?"". Brooker compared the last twist to a ""punch line"" ending of a Twilight Zone episode, initially concerned that it would be too humorous, but finding it ""harrowing and horrifying"" in the edit.[6] He later found that this episode's ending was the one most commonly misunderstood by viewers, though Trachtenberg's observation had been that most people understood the twist.[14]

Some ideas for the episode were changed or unused. Cooper's relationship with his mother was changed, from her being neurotic and doting to Cooper taking her for granted.[11] In one draft, Cooper was told he was a character in Black Mirror as a way of breaking the fourth wall.[11] In this storyline, he would discover other characters and locations from previous episodes.[15] Brooker also wished to have a Nightmare Mode, where different scenes would be shown to the viewer when they watched the episode a second time.[11] Alternate scenes were a key concept of the later interactive film Black Mirror: Bandersnatch, which incorporated viewer decisions into the story.[14][16]

Wyatt Russell stars in the episode as Cooper. Trachtenberg said that this casting led to the character's arrogance being toned down so that the audience is ""rooting for him to learn a lesson"".[12] Hannah John-Kamen appears in this episode as Sonja, after appearing briefly in the unrelated role of a singer in the series one episode ""Fifteen Million Merits"". Brooker noted that they were initially going to have the song John-Kamen sang in ""Fifteen Million Merits"" playing on the radio in one scene but were unable due to a licensing issue.[5][17] Other roles include Wunmi Mosaku as Katie, who runs the experiment, and Ken Yamamura as Shou, the video game company owner.[18]

""Playtest"" was the last episode of the third series to be filmed. Initially, production would have taken place in Tokyo, a key hub for video game development, with mansion scenes filmed in the United Kingdom, but the writers found it difficult to explain in-story why such a house would exist in or near Japan. Instead, they decided to make the episode take place in London, a location they had ready access to but had not prominently featured in the series before.[14] Exterior shots of SaitoGemu's headquarters used Englefield House.[19] The sets for SaitoGemu were created from an abandoned school building, while scenes in Harlech House were filmed in the home of an elderly woman.[11] The animation company Framestore worked on the effects, tasked with making the small realistic spider that Cooper first sees and the deformed version that later appears.[14] Additional shots of the house for special effects were made by rendering the home within the Unity game engine.[11]

Trachtenberg wanted to film scenes in order, but this was not always possible. He commented that some scenes are shot in a similar way to 10 Cloverfield Lane, including some scenes which were cut because of their similarities.[10] In the early Harlech House scenes, Russell was encouraged to experiment with Cooper's reactions; for instance, a 14-minute take of Cooper insulting his childhood bully Josh Peters was filmed.[11] Trachtenberg experimented with Russell and John-Kamen improvising, making them add lines to the middle or the end of their dialogue.[12] Trachtenberg wanted the penultimate scene, with Cooper returning home, as a one-shot take, given the drastic change in tone it gave the episode.[11]

The episode is a work of psychological horror;[20] Adam Chitwood of Collider found it ""genuinely terrifying"", while Chancellor Agard of Entertainment Weekly believed it to contain ""one of the show's most viscerally disturbing scenes"".[21][22] Charles Bramesco of Vulture compared it to the 1999 sci-fi thriller Existenz because of both works' focus on distorting reality.[23] Reviewers found that the episode explored the themes of humans' flawed perception of reality. Rebecca Hawkes of The Telegraph said that the episode made a connection between ""futuristic technology"" and fears around the question ""if we can't trust our own flawed senses, what on earth can we trust?""[24] In relation to the mushroom drawing inspiration from Cooper's fears, Roxanne Sancto of Paste wrote that people have aimed to explore ""this confrontation with the darkest corners of our subconscious"" before modern technology, such as with dream analysis, hallucinogens or hypnosis.[25] The character Katie says that the experimental technology adds ""layers on top of reality"", with Bramesco commenting that the episode's construction is this in reverse.[23] Bryan Bishop of The Verge found that other themes covered include the ethics of experiments on human beings and the importance of resolving family issues.[26]

The primary technology of the episode drew comparisons to augmented reality and contemporary virtual reality technologies including Oculus Rift and Microsoft HoloLens.[13][26] Bishop also compared it to an increase in demand for interactive entertainment such as escape rooms and immersive theatre.[26] Agard said that the episode ""takes the desire of escapism"" in these forms of entertainment to a ""deadly conclusion"".[22] Hawkes drew a ""thematic link"" between the technology and Cooper's fears of dementia, saying that ""none of us are really in control of our own minds, memories and 'self'"".[24] Vox's Alex Abad-Santos interpreted the episode to make a broader point about the way smartphones have changed human interaction, observing that Cooper needs very little other than a smartphone to travel the world and meet people. Abad-Santos further said that though viewers may expect characters to be revealed as evil, none are, and concluded that ""the greatest threat to yourself isn't the strangers you meet through your phone, but rather your own dishonesty"".[27]

The episode shows futuristic technology at the headquarters of SaitoGemu, Bishop describing the setting as ""full of all-white rooms and silent worker bees tapping away dutifully behind minimalist visor displays"".[26] The later parts of the episode take place in a 19th-century gothic mansion, and the setting is contrasted with the holograms and futuristic technology of the episode.[26][28] The episode uses foreshadowing: for instance, a flight attendant tells Cooper to turn off his phone during turbulence, similar to how his phone signal interference later causes the mushroom to glitch.[29]

To hint that most of the episode takes place inside Cooper's mind, features from early scenes were incorporated as background elements later on. Cooper met Sonja at The Raven Pub, so finds Edgar Allan Poe's ""The Raven"" in Harlech House.[11] A poster for the film Red Sonja in Sonja's apartment foreshadows her face being torn off.[14] Cooper's method of killing Sonja by slamming her head onto the knife through his shoulder evokes the position in which the pair woke up that morning. Another act of foreshadowing is the movie Cooper watches on the plane about a monstrous spider, as he faces an enormous spider in Harlech House.[13][14] Bishop saw the spider as a reference to the 1982 film The Thing.[26] Cooper also sits next to a girl whose face is used for a creepy portrait and sees a SaitoGemu employee designing a costume which later appears on Josh Peters.[13][14]

The episode contains a number of video game-related references.[13][30] Trachtenberg included several of his favourite video games as props on a shelf in Sonja's room,[12][13] while many video game consoles are seen at SaitoGemu. Matt Miller of Game Informer found a similarity between Shou and the ""enigmatic nature"" of the video game designer Hideo Kojima. Other references include a mural to Pac-Man that Cooper visits in London and non-video game references such as a copy of the 1997 action film Face/Off.[13]

Harlech House resembles the house in the 1996 game Resident Evil, and Cooper's surname ""Redfield"" is another reference to the game. As Cooper approaches a door while speaking to the operator, she asks ""would you kindly open the door?"", an allusion to the phrase's usage in the 2007 game BioShock. This phrase related to whether players follow instructions unquestioningly, which Miller saw as related to its occurrence in ""Playtest"".[13]

On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 86% of 22 reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The site's summary describes that its ""psychologically horrifying worldÂ ... is nicely counterbalanced by the sheer likability of the episode's protagonist"".[4] Hawkes rated the episode three stars out of five,[24] while Sancto rated it 9.4 out of 10.[25] ""Playtest"" garnered B ratings from Agard and The A.V. Club's Zach Handlen.[22][29] Alex Mullane of Digital Spy called the episode the ""most visceral and intense"" of the show to date.[28] Hawkes found it ""enjoyably sinister"".[24]

The episode's plot and meaning received mixed reception and the ending was criticised. Bishop found that it ""never digs particularly deep"",[26] and Handlen criticised ""a disappointingly unfocused"" plot about a ""fairly cliched concept"".[29] David Sims of The Atlantic reviewed that the resolution to questions raised in the first half of the episode is ""disappointingly facile"".[20] Hawkes saw the episode as choosing to ""swap deeper probing for a succession of clever shocks"".[24] Handlen felt that there were too many twists, the final one being ""a shrug of a conclusion that's little more than a dark joke"".[29] Sims said that the final reveal ""feels a little forced, blunting the tragedy of Cooper's death"".[20] Bishop summarised the twists as ""an endurance test of what-is-real fake-out endings"".[26] Nevertheless, Hawkes found it ""bitterly funny"" as a punchline and as keeping with the theme of the show.[24] Sancto believed that the ending was ""particularly powerful"" and improved by Russell's ""genuine expressions of hopelessness and confusion"".[25]

The directing, setting and effects garnered praise. Bishop reviewed that creepy moments and jump scares are built up well and timed appropriately.[26] Bramesco found the approach to horror ""sparing"", and believed that it ""works so fearsomely well"".[23] Sims praised that Trachtenberg is simultaneously able to draw attention to and joke about horror movie tropes ""while still having the scares land"".[20] Mullane found Harlech House to be an ""incredible set"", also reviewing the special effects as ""fantastic throughout"".[28] Agard commented that the pacing in the first half of the episode is slow,[22] while Handlen reviewed that its hourlong runtimeâ€”lengthier than episodes in previous seriesâ€”was ""both a strength and its greatest weakness"".[29]

Russell's performance as Cooper received acclaim. Sims and Chitwood summarised his character as a ""cheerful American fish-out-of-water"" and ""an ambitious and somewhat dim-witted American"", respectively.[20][21] Bramesco wrote that he ""pulls off a difficult performance"",[23] whilst Mullane said that Russell was ""so convincingly terrified and frazzled throughout that you'll forget you're watching a piece of fiction"".[28] Sancto said that Russell brought ""vigorous emotion"" to the role,[25] while Sims said that he ""makes the tonal shift feel subtle"".[20] Mullane additionally praised Hannah John-Kamen as ""extremely likeable"", and said that the pair had ""strong"" chemistry.[28]

""Playtest"" received mixed positions on many critics' rankings of the 23 instalments in the Black Mirror series, from best to worst.



IndieWire authors ranked the 22 Black Mirror instalments excluding Bandersnatch by quality, giving ""Playtest"" a position of 10th.[39] Eric Anthony Glover of Entertainment Tonight found the episode to be the worst of the 19 episodes from series one to four.[40] Meanwhile, Brian Tallerico of Vulture rated Russell's performance the sixth best of Black Mirror, praising him as ""a truly charismatic and engaging actor"".[41] Additionally, Proma Khosla of Mashable ranked the same instalments by tone, concluding that ""Playtest"" was the fourth most bleak.[42]

Other critics ranked the 13 episodes in Black Mirror's first three series.

Some critics ranked the six episodes from series three of Black Mirror in order of quality.

For their work on visual effects in ""Playtest"", multiple individuals and groups were nominated for a British Academy Television Craft Award, a Royal Television Society Craft & Design Award and a Visual Effects Society Award in 2017.[49][50][51] The episode was also submitted for consideration alongside ""Nosedive"" and ""San Junipero"" for an Art Directors Guild award for Excellence in Production Design for a Television Movie or Limited Series, for which it was nominated.[52]

Shut Up and Dance,"

""Shut Up and Dance"" is the third episode of the third series of the British science fiction anthology series Black Mirror. It was written by series creator and showrunner Charlie Brooker and William Bridges, and premiered on Netflix on 21 October 2016, together with the rest of series three.

The episode tells the story of a teenage boy, Kenny (Alex Lawther), who is blackmailed into committing bizarre and criminal acts by anonymous hackers in possession of a video of him masturbating. The teen is joined by a middle-aged man (Jerome Flynn), who is also being blackmailed over infidelity. The episode is dark in tone and has themes related to a previous episode, ""White Bear"".

""Shut Up and Dance"" received mixed reviews. Critics praised Lawther and Flynn's acting, but were polarised as to whether the episode's tone was effective, whether the plot twist was good and whether the episode had interesting themes. It was ranked poorly in critics' lists of Black Mirror instalments by quality.

Kenny (Alex Lawther) returns home from his restaurant job to find that his sister Lindsey (Maya Gerber) has unintentionally infected his laptop with malware. He downloads an anti-malware trojan, allowing unseen hackers to record him masturbating through his webcam; they email the teenager, threatening to leak the footage if he refuses to comply.

At work, Kenny receives a text summoning him to a location 15 miles (24 kilometres) away in 45 minutes. Feigning illness to leave, he frantically cycles there and is met by another blackmail victim (Ivanno Jeremiah), who passes Kenny a box containing a cake. Ordered to deliver the cake to a hotel room, Kenny meets Hector (Jerome Flynn), whom the hackers also contact. He had arranged to commit adultery with a prostitute and fears he will lose custody of his children if his wife Penny (Leanne Best) finds out.

The two are told to drive to a set of coordinates. Stopping for petrol, they meet Karen (Natasha Little), a friend of Hector's wife, who requests a lift home. Hector drives recklessly to get her there before continuing to their destination. Tasked with using a gun concealed in the cake to rob a bank, Hector insists on being the driver, leaving Kenny to perform the robbery. Despite urinating in his panic, he steals a bag of cash and flees the scene with Hector.

Hector is instructed to destroy the car, while Kenny takes the money to a drop site in a forest. He meets another victim (Paul Bazely), who explains they are to fight to the death whilst being filmed through a drone; the winner earns the money. When Kenny protests that he was merely masturbating to photos, his opponent asks how young the subjects were, revealing he is a paedophile and implying Kenny is, too. Kenny attempts suicide, but discovers the gun from earlier is empty and the two fight.

Arriving home, Hector is texted a Trollface, learning the blackmailers have disclosed evidence of his infidelity to Penny regardless. The others' information is also released. A shellshocked Kenny staggers from the woods injured. His mother (Camilla Power) phones him, shocked that Lindsey and her friends have seen the video of him ""looking at kids"". As she begs Kenny to tell her none of it is true, he hangs up, receiving a Trollface image as police arrive and apprehend him.

Whilst series one and two of Black Mirror were shown on Channel 4 in the UK, in September 2015 Netflix commissioned the series for 12 episodes (split into two series of six episodes).[3] In March 2016, Netflix outbid Channel 4 for the rights to distributing the third series, with a bid of $40 million.[4] Due to its move to Netflix, the show had a larger budget than in previous series.[5] ""Shut Up and Dance"" is the third episode of the third series;[6] all six episodes in this series were released on Netflix simultaneously on 21 October 2016. As Black Mirror is an anthology series, each episode is standalone.[7]

The titles of the six episodes that make up series 3 were announced in July 2016, along with the release date.[8] A trailer for series three, featuring an amalgamation of clips and sound bites from the six episodes, was released by Netflix on 7 October 2016.[9] Two days prior to the release of series 3 on Netflix, Den of Geek! published an interview in which Brooker hinted that the episode is ""a grimy, contemporary nightmare"" set in London, with no science fiction elements.[10]

The episode was co-written by series creator Charlie Brooker and William Bridges, who was new to the television industry. Bridges pitched three ideas to Brooker and executive producer Annabel Jones and although none of them were developed further, he was sent a draft script of ""Shut Up and Dance"" to work on.[11] Brooker stated that the absence of science fiction elements from the episode was a ""very conscious"" decision, noting that science fiction is also absent from series one episode ""The National Anthem"" and series two episode ""The Waldo Moment"".[12] Having recently written series three episode ""San Junipero"", which was conceived of as a 1980s period piece, Brooker was interested in writing a present-day story.[13][12] He commented that the ""weird, British, colloquial nasty humour"" and ""seediness"" of the episode is similar to ""The National Anthem"".[11]

The story went through many different iterations, starting from an idea similar to 1992 heist film Reservoir Dogs, where a group of strangers were tossed together to commit a robbery.[11] Some drafts did not imply that Kenny was looking at child pornography. In one version of the story, there was no reason why the events were happening, and in another the roles were reversed, with Hector having the extremely dark secret.[12] In a different draft, the hackers were shown in an internet cafÃ© in Eastern Europe, having blackmailed the characters for fun.[11] The episode was originally set in the United States, as this would make it easier for the characters to access a gun, and the timeframe of the storyline was initially longer.[11]

The episode was filmed over a three-week period; it was the second in the series to be filmed, after ""San Junipero"".[14] Director James Watkins had previously directed horror films Eden Lake (2008) and The Woman in Black (2012), which Lawther says made Watkins ""really [learn] the craft of sustaining incredible suspense over long periods of time.""[15] It was Watkins' first experience directing television.[11] Having seen art department preparations for series three episodes ""Nosedive"" and ""San Junipero"", Watkins aimed to deviate from their tones to ""embrace being the ugly cousin"".[11] Alex Lawther plays the main character Kenny; having been a fan of the programme prior to auditioning, Lawther particularly liked series two episode ""White Bear"". When first auditioning, Lawther had only seen the script for a couple of scenes and was unaware of the twist ending.[15]

Lawther's first proper meeting with co-star Jerome Flynn was during shooting of in the in-car scenes. Filming was intense, with Flynn hyperventilating at times, though there was also corpsing (breaking into laughter) from Flynn, Lawther and Natasha Little, who played Hector's wife's friend Karen.[11] Lawther played Kenny as if he were innocent, as his character is very repressed about his sexual proclivities. He also believed that Kenny feels constantly uncomfortable. Kenny handing a toy back to the girl who had left it behind in the cafe was intended as a hint to Kenny being a paedophile; there were discussions over how the scene should be acted to avoid giving away the twist. After struggling to find a parent who was happy to have their daughter act as the girl, Jones had her own daughter play the role.[11] Lawther commented that whilst filming, he saw a news story similar to the episode's storyline, which he found surreal.[15]

The ending features Radiohead's ""Exit Music (For a Film)"", initially included as a temporary track during editing. The producers received permission from Radiohead to use the song as they liked Black Mirror.[11]

The episode was found to be the most similar to prior Black Mirror episodes out of those in the third series.[16] Pat Stacey of the Irish Independent noted that it is the only episode of the series set entirely in England,[16] whilst Alex Mullane of Digital Spy compared it to a ""British version"" of 1995 action film Die Hard with a Vengeance, as the main character ""is led on a not-so-merry chase around the city"".[17] Sean Fitz-Gerald of Thrillist wrote that it is a ""dark thriller"" which is both ""a very atypical and very classic Black Mirror story"".[2] The episode's tone was seen by Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph as the ""most nihilistic"" Black Mirror episode to that point; he commented that its ""vision of humanity"" is ""uncompromisingly negative"" and that it leaves an ""acrid aftertaste"".[18]

Stuart Joy, writer of the book Through the Black Mirror: Deconstructing the Side Effects of the Digital Age, analysed that the portrayal of Kenny as youthful deceives the viewer and challenges societal perceptions of paedophiles. Lawther said of the script: ""How brilliant [it was] that they'd made me sympathize with a paedophile for so long, and the complexity of that, because he's so young"". His character is 19 years old, a withdrawn and socially-awkward teenager who is easily intimidated by workplace bullies and infantilised by his mother. Joy noted that Kenny's attitude towards sex is indicative of immaturity. Questioned by the much older Hector about what the hackers had caught him doing, Kenny refuses to say the word ""masturbation"", instead using the euphemism ""doing it"". Other moments emphasising his childlike nature include a series of nervous tics, twitches and stutters exhibited by Kenny, as well as a moment where he urinates himself out of terror when forced to commit a bank robbery.[19]

Sophie Gilbert of The Atlantic compared the episode to previous episodes with contemporary settingsâ€”series one's ""The National Anthem"" and series two's ""White Bear"" and ""The Waldo Moment"". She also compared it to the 2001 special episode ""Paedogeddon!"" of the television news satire Brass Eye, which Brooker co-wrote. ""Paedogeddon!"" aimed to ""lampoon the kind of moral panic and mob fury that's unleashed whenever the subject of child abuse is up for debate"".[20] Fitz-Gerald, Gilbert and Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club commented that the episode's themes resemble those in ""White Bear"".[2][20][21] Handlen wrote that the audience must question ""the danger of unsupervised vigilantism even when the victims arguably deserve what's coming to them"", calling Kenny a ""still sympathetic"" character ""not deserving"" of his punishment, though he is ""disturbed and troubled and in need of some serious counseling"".[21] Fitz-Gerald believed that all of the characters are ""depraved [...] to a degree"", noting that the internet brings out bad behaviour in people.[2]

Handlen called the episode ""one of the most pervasive nightmares of the modern age"", as it asks: ""What if someone's watching you at your most vulnerable?""[21] Mullane opined that the episode is ""a cautionary tale about placing yourself in precarious positions online, particularly when it comes to sexting, images, and pornography"".[17] Fitz-Gerald summarised that the episode was a ""hypothetical extreme"" of hacking and trolling, and asked whether human nature and advanced technology are compatible.[2] However, Caroline Framke of Vox believed that although the episode ""might ostensibly be about the dangers of hacking, or trying to live a double life in a world that makes secrets all too easy to access"", it relies on the feeling of shame. The episode asks: ""How far would you go to keep your shame safely hidden?""[1]

Josh Dzieza of The Verge commented that the anonymous hackers mark ""a bit of a departure"" for the programme, which usually does not feature ""overt villains"".[22] Mullane analysed that the hackers' identities do not need to be revealed as they are ""effectively a stand-in for The Internet: all-seeing, all-knowing, and extremely dangerous"".[17] The supposed malware remover that Kenny downloads is called ""shrive"", a word from Middle English meaning ""to prescribe penance"" (the same root word is used for Shrove Tuesday).[18] Gilbert commented that in light of this, ""the gauntlet Kenny, Hector, and others are forced to run throughout the episode seems to be a kind of punishment for their sins, but at the end, none of them are forgiven"".[20]

Rotten Tomatoes reported that 65% of critics have given the episode a positive review based on 23 reviews, with an average rating of 8.50/10. The site's critics consensus reads, ""Terrifically tense and twisty, ""Shut Up and Dance"" is well-paced and incredibly unsettling, leaving viewers stunned and with a greater distaste for humanity than normally evoked from an average episode Black Mirror.""[6] ""Shut Up and Dance"" received ratings of five out of five stars by Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph,[18] four out of five stars by Pat Stacey of The Irish Independent[16] and a B class rating by Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club.[21] The episode's themes received mixed reception. Mullane wrote that the story was no deeper than one where ""bad people do bad things and then get punished for it"".[17] Gilbert called it redundant to series two episode ""White Bear"", saying that there was ""no clear message or moment of redemption to take away from it"".[20] However, Handlen approved of the episode's themes, praising its ""willingness to force moral questions that make everyone feel awful"".[21]

Alex Lawther's performance as Kenny was universally well received. Described by Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter as ""one of the best things of 2016"",[23] Handlen concurred that Lawther is ""the real stand-out"" of the episode,[21] while Mullane wrote that he is ""superb in the main role"".[17] Dzieza praised Lawther's portrayal of ""adolescent desperation"",[22] whilst Framke commented that his depiction of Kenny was ""quivering, desperate, heartbreaking"". Framke stated that Lawther's ""incredible, vulnerable performance"" made her ""sympathise with his terror"", which she found crucial to the twist.[1]

Jerome Flynn's acting of Hector was also praised. Mullane wrote that his character is ""suitably sleazy, without ever being a caricature"",[17] whilst Framke praised his ""coiled anger"", describing the character as ""gruff and to the point"" and ""furious at his total helplessness"".[1] Dzieza praised Flynn's ""unsettling"" contrast between ""gruffness and utilitarian friendliness"".[22] Collin opined that ""the deliciously horrible details of Flynnâ€™s performance sell you on his character's predicament in a snap"".[18] However, Handlen commented that though Flynn ""does a fine job"", the episode is not a ""showcase"" for him.[21]

Critics were polarised as to whether the tone of the episode was effective. Whilst Matt Fowler of IGN wrote that it was ""remarkably heart-pounding""[24] and Stacey found it ""fantastically tense"",[16] Gilbert commented that it ""felt like too much of an endurance test""[20] and Framke believed that there was not much suspense prior to the twist ending.[1] Fitz-Gerald experienced a ""mounting sense of anxiety"" as ""Kenny's hopelessness as a puppet to anonymous sociopaths is palpable"",[2] but Adam Chitwood of Collider found the tension too frustrating,[25] and Handlen wrote that the episode is ""never boring, but it's not all that engaging, either"".[21] Gilbert found it more upsetting than any prior episode,[20] and Dzieza commented that the episode's aesthetics are ""chilly and claustrophobic"".[22] Dzieza further said that the ""queasiness"" up to the twist is ""well orchestrated"", but found the ending ""a letdown"".[22] Stacey said that the episode was ""blackly funny"",[16] with Gilbert concurring that the scenes involving Hector's wife's friend Karen contained some of the darkest humour of the show.[20]

The twist ending in which Kenny is revealed to be a paedophile received a mixed reaction from critics. Handlen opined that it is ""not quite powerful enough to make up for everything that came before it"",[21] with Framke agreeing that it ""doesn't hit that hard"".[1] Fitz-Gerald said that ""I half hate it, half love it.""[2] Mullane called it ""a huge gut-punch"", but criticised that ""it also removes any anchor for investment in any of these characters"".[17] Dzieza commented that it demonstrated that ""the episode is more interested in turning gadgets into weapons of maximum humiliation than in saying anything more interesting about how digital humiliation works"".[22] However, Mullane opined that the episode's ending ""perfectly captures the bleak mood of the piece and the inescapable claustrophobia of these people's situations"".[17]

Director James Watkins was praised by Mullane and Collin for creating tension,[17][18] with Collin writing that Watkins ""keeps his camera on its feet and hungry"" during moments of tension and Kenny's chase sequences.[18] However, the episode was criticised as too long by Framke and Chitwood, with Framke attributing this to the programme's move to Netflix.[1][25]

""Shut Up and Dance"" appeared on many critics' rankings of the 23 instalments in the Black Mirror series, from best to worst.



Following the fifth series, Brian Tallerico of Vulture rated Lawther's performance as Kenny the eleventh best performance in the show.[34] Additionally, Proma Khosla of Mashable ranked the 22 Black Mirror instalments excluding Bandersnatch by tone, concluding that ""Shut Up and Dance"" was the second most bleak after ""The Waldo Moment"".[35]

San Junipero,"

""San Junipero"" is the fourth episode in the third series of the British science fiction anthology television series Black Mirror. Written by series creator and showrunner Charlie Brooker and directed by Owen Harris, it premiered on Netflix on 21 October 2016, with the rest of series three.

The episode is set in a beach resort town named San Junipero, where the introverted Yorkie (Mackenzie Davis) meets the more outgoing Kelly (Gugu Mbatha-Raw). The town is part of a simulated reality the elderly can inhabit, even after death. ""San Junipero"" was the first episode written for series three of Black Mirror; initial drafts were based on nostalgia therapy and designed as a 1980s period piece. The first script was about a heterosexual couple and had an unhappy ending; the final version was about a lesbian couple and had a happy ending. Filming took place in London and Cape Town across a few weeks. The soundtrack interweaves 1980s songs with an original score by Clint Mansell.

The episode received critical acclaim, with particular praise for Mbatha-Raw's and Davis's performances, its plot twist, its visual style, and its uplifting tone (atypical for the show). It had higher critical ratings than the show's other episodes, while some critics considered it one of the best television episodes of 2016. In addition to several other accolades, ""San Junipero"" won two Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Television Movie and Outstanding Writing for a Limited Series, Movie, or Dramatic Special.

In 1987, a shy young woman named Yorkie (Mackenzie Davis) visits the nightclub Tucker's in San Junipero. Kelly (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), a vivacious party girl, rebuffs the advances of Wes (Gavin Stenhouse) to talk to Yorkie. Kelly and Yorkie dance, but Yorkie becomes uncomfortable and leaves the club. Kelly follows and sexually propositions Yorkie, who declines, saying she is engaged. The following week, Yorkie returns to the bar and observes Kelly flirting with another man. Yorkie and Kelly reunite in the bathroom, kiss there, and end up having sex at Kelly's beach house. Yorkie confesses that it was her first time having sex, and Kelly reveals that she was once married.

The next week, Yorkie visits another nightclub, the BDSM-themed Quagmire, looking for Kelly. Wes advises her to ""try a different time"". Yorkie visits Tucker's in a few different decades until she finds Kelly in 2002, but Kelly rejects her. After Yorkie leaves, Kelly follows and confesses she is dying; Kelly had avoided Yorkie because she feared developing feelings for her. The two have sex again, and Yorkie reluctantly tells Kelly she lives in Santa Rosa, California, so they can meet.

San Junipero is revealed to be a simulated reality where the deceased can live, and the elderly can visit, all inhabiting their younger selves' bodies in a time of their choice. In the physical world, the elderly Kelly (Denise Burse) visits Yorkie (Annabel Davis). She learns from Yorkie's nurse Greg (Raymond McAnally) that Yorkie was paralysed at age 21 after crashing her car when her parents reacted negatively to her coming out. Yorkie wishes to be euthanised to live in San Junipero permanently, but her family objects; she intends to marry Greg so that he can consent for her. Kelly offers to marry Yorkie instead, and after she enthusiastically accepts, Kelly authorises Yorkie's euthanasia.

During Kelly's next visit to San Junipero, Yorkie asks her to stay full-time. Kelly says she plans to die without being uploaded to the simulation; her husband chose the same fate because their daughter died before San Junipero existed. Yorkie and Kelly argue, and Kelly leaves in her car, which she intentionally crashes. Yorkie catches up to her just as Kelly disappears, her visiting time over for the week.

Time passes and Kelly decides she is ready to enter San Junipero permanently. She is euthanised and buried alongside her family, and she happily reunites with Yorkie in San Junipero.

""San Junipero"" is the fourth episode of series three of Black Mirror; all six episodes in this series were simultaneously released on Netflix on 21 October 2016. Whilst series one and two of Black Mirror were shown on Channel 4 in the UK, Netflix commissioned the series for 12 episodes (split into two series of six episodes) in September 2015 with a bid of $40 million,[1][2] and in March 2016, Netflix outbid Channel 4 for the right to distribute series three in the UK.[2] Due to its move to Netflix, the show had a larger budget than in previous series,[3] and a larger episode order which allowed the show to vary its genre and tone more than previous series.[4] Alongside series three episode ""Nosedive"", ""San Junipero"" was first shown in 2016 ahead of its Netflix release at the Toronto International Film Festival.[5]

I'd read people saying, 'Oh no! It's going to get all American!' so I said, fuck it, I'm going to set it in California, fuck you, I'll choose protagonists that wouldn't necessarily leap into my head, and I'll explore a hopeful use of technology to shut up people who think it's written by the Unabomber.

Charlie Brooker, interview with The Daily Beast.[6]

""San Junipero"" was the first script produced for series three,[7] written by Charlie Brooker as a ""conscious decision to change the series"".[8] The show previously focused on technology's negative effects;[9] this episode served as proof that uplifting Black Mirror episodes are possible.[8]

Brooker initially envisioned an episode in which technology is used to investigate whether an afterlife exists,[6] thinking of the genres of horror and supernatural fiction.[10] He later became inspired by nostalgia therapy, wherein elderly people are immersed in music and fashion from their youth.[11] Brooker and executive producer Annabel Jones felt that their concept of virtual consciousness, established in the episode ""White Christmas"", had more potential.[10] One of Brooker's original concepts was based on the episode ""Be Right Back"", in which deceased persons' personalities are uploaded into artificial entities in a theme park that relatives can visit. This idea was scrapped with the 2016 broadcast of Westworld, in which humans visit a theme park inhabited by androids.[10] He then recalled the 2010 BBC series The Young Ones, in which older celebrities live in a home decorated in the fashion of the 1970s and find themselves rejuvenated by the setting.[10][12] Having repeatedly thought of writing an episode set in the past,[7] Brooker wrote ""San Junipero"" as a period episode.[13]

Brooker has said that he wrote the script for the episode in four days.[8] In the initial draft, the love story was about a heterosexual couple, but Brooker changed it to give the episode an extra resonance, as same-sex marriage was not legal in 1987.[13] He has said that having a twist makes the writing process easier, as ""when you know that 85 percent of what's happening you can't reveal till later on, it actually sort of narrows your options in a useful way"".[14] One draft of the episode contained a scene where Kelly visits a kindergarten in San Junipero, full of children who had died, but it was removed because ""it was too sad and too poignant of a note to hit in that story"".[15] Brooker chose the setting of California, a location in America rather than Britain, as a way to ""upend"" people's preconceptions of Black Mirror.[6] One reviewer noted that all of the characters in ""San Junipero"" are American.[5]

The episode was originally to have an unhappy ending.[13] Brooker told The Daily Beast that in the rough treatment, the episode ended with the scene where Kelly and Yorkie meet in the hospital, but ""when I sat down to actually write it, I was enjoying it so much that I thought, No, I'm going to keep going!""[6] He conceived of Yorkie's euthanasia and expanded on Kelly's backstory, writing her emotional speech to Yorkie in one sitting.[10] The ending came about when Brooker heard ""Heaven is a Place on Earth"" off a streaming playlist while writing the script, and wanted to license the song for the episode. After listening to the song and lyrics several times, he came to the final shot, which shows a bank of computer servers with flashing lights, giving literal weight to the song's title.[10] An unused idea for the ending had the audience see Kelly and Yorkie in many different eras, such as the 1920s.[16]

Following the episode's release, Brooker was asked about a Reddit post speculating that Kelly is simulated for Yorkie's benefit, rather than really there; he replied ""Wrong! They are together"",[17] and commented that ""[t]hey have the happiest ending imaginable. [...] it's not a big rainbow sandwich, but what appears to be happening there, is happening there.""[16]

The nightclub settings featured arcade games, which Brooker took an interest in choosing as he was a teenager during the 1980s and has worked as a video game journalist.[11] Director Owen Harris described the 1980s as a ""period in life that was really optimistic"".[18] He chose the year 1987 ""fairly arbitrarily"" and mentioned ""very specific movie posters"" in the script. Brooker put together a playlist of music from 1987 on Spotify.[19] Some songs, such as Belinda Carlisle's ""Heaven Is a Place on Earth"" and the Smiths' ""Girlfriend in a Coma"", hint at the episode's plot twist,[20] as do arcade games Time Crisis and The House of the Dead.[10] Each song had to be cleared for roughly 15 years for Netflix. Every song was successfully cleared except one by Prince.[19]

""Heaven Is a Place on Earth"" plays at the episode's beginning and over the end credits. Brooker first heard it while running, and believed it would be perfect for the final scene, admitting in an interview he would have been ""absolutely distraught"" if they had been unable to use it.[13] ""Girlfriend in a Coma"" features in the episode ""for about five seconds"", yet cost ""an outrageous amount of money"", Brooker said. Jones said the song's inclusion ""was indulgent but at the same time, it was so important that we set up that era so it felt different"".[19] Robbie Nevil's song ""C'est La Vie"" was chosen by Harris, as it was one of the first singles he ever purchased.[18]

The episode also featured an original score by Clint Mansell. Mansell was approached by Harris, and based the score around the previously chosen songs, including ""Heaven Is a Place on Earth"". He has said that the ""calm electronic"" score was influenced by John Hughes movies and the death of his girlfriend a year before.[21] In December 2016, Lakeshore Records released the score for downloading and streaming.[22]

Gugu Mbatha-Raw, who plays Kelly, had heard of the show but not seen it when she received the script, though she did watch the series two episode ""Be Right Back"" before the shoot. Mbatha-Raw read the entire script as soon as she received it, on a bus journey from Oxford Circus to Brixton.[23] Mackenzie Davis, who plays Yorkie, first saw the show with a friend who had pirated it; they watched ""The National Anthem"".[24] Denise Burse plays the elder Kelly in the real world, as using prosthetics on Mbatha-Raw was quickly discounted. Annabel Davis was cast as elder Yorkie.[10]

The episode's director was Owen Harris, who previously directed ""Be Right Back""[5] â€“ an episode he described as ""strangely similar"" to this one as both are ""relationship-led"".[18] Joel Collins served as production designer. The 1986 teen films Pretty in Pink and Ferris Bueller's Day Off were considered as inspiration to anchor the audience in ""a place they know"".[10] The episode was filmed in 15 days across a three-week period,[10][23] with shooting split equally between London for most of the interior shots, and Cape Town, South Africa, for most external scenes. They did not film in the United States as a cost-cutting measure.[6][10] Mbatha-Raw said there was little time to rehearse,[23] and she had little opportunity to meet Davis before shooting. Kelly's outfit was inspired by celebrities of the 1980s such as Janet Jackson and Whitney Houston, while Yorkie's outfit ""looks like her mum laid it out on her bed"", according to Davis. Her clothing is constant throughout the episode to subvert a ""transforming geek"" trope in fiction, also allowing her change to be internal rather than external.[10]

The first day of filming was in London for the Quagmire nightclub, shot on location in the Electrowerkz nightclub venue in Islington.[25][26] For the club Tucker's, a 3D model was made, which Brooker and Harris viewed with a virtual reality headset. Mbatha-Raw and Davis worked with a dance choreographer and danced to Janet Jackson's ""What Have You Done for Me Lately"", though Alexander O'Neal's ""Fake"" was used in the final edit. The alleyway scene features rain, which Harris insisted on including despite Brooker's protestations that the simulated world would not have rain.[10] Harris said that Cape Town ""has these really rich, beautiful settings"" that allowed him to craft a ""slightly heightened"" version of California. He noted that whilst shooting Kelly and Yorkie's argument on the beach, an ""incredible mist rolled in from the ocean"", which caused difficulties but led to ""some really lovely texture"".[18] Mbatha-Raw said that almost every scene was shot at night or dusk, particularly the exterior scenes.[24]

The episode contains hints leading up to the reveal of the twist. For example, the choice of the song ""Girlfriend in a Coma"", and the use of the arcade games Time Crisis and The House of the Dead allude to the true reality of the episode.[10] More overtly, Yorkie reacts viscerally to seeing a car accident in an arcade game, an element that Brooker was surprised was not picked up by viewers earlier.[10] A factor considered during the editing process was how overt the hints should be. Annabel Jones said that ""there may be visual signifiers that you think were going to work and then didn't, so you need more exposition in the edit"". Adjustments were also made using sound design techniques such as sound effects.[14]

The titles of the six episodes that make up series 3 were announced in July 2016, along with the release date.[27] A trailer for series three, featuring an amalgamation of clips and sound bites from the six episodes, was released by Netflix on 7 October 2016.[28] A short clip ""Orange Is the New Black Mirror"", released by Netflix in 2017, is a crossover between this episode and Orange is the New Black, featuring characters Poussey and Taystee from the latter reunited in San Junipero.[11]

Reviewers have described ""San Junipero"" as a highly optimistic,[29] emotionally rooted[30] love story and a work of science fiction.[31] It features the first same-sex couple in Black Mirror.[31] Rebecca Nicholson of The Guardian wrote that it ""leaves you believing in the power of love to fight pain and loneliness"".[29] Some reviewers noted that the love story ""transcends consciousness"".[32][33] The episode also has unhappy elements[31][34] and has been called ""bittersweet"".[35] It evokes nostalgia for the 1980s with its soundtrack and its style,[36] and can be considered a period piece.[13][37] It also raises questions about death and the afterlife.[38] Esquire reviewer Emma Dibdin called it a ""modern fairy tale"".[39]

At the time of its release, ""San Junipero"" was said to be the most different from other Black Mirror episodes due to its more hopeful tone.[4] Mat Elfring of GameSpot described it as the only episode with ""warmth to it"",[40] and Digital Spy reviewer Morgan Jeffery called it the ""most upbeat and positive"".[36] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club believed that the previous episodes' sad tone heightens the effectiveness of ""San Junipero"",[41] and Jacob Stolworthy of The Independent thought that it was consequently the show's most ambitious episode.[42] Variety critic Sonia Saraiya pointed out that technology is portrayed as good in ""San Junipero"", a rarity in the show.[43] The Atlantic reviewer David Sims noted that the episode follows the season's darkest episode, ""Shut Up and Dance"".[44]

The episode subverts a common trope in television of killing off lesbian characters: though Kelly and Yorkie die, they have a happy ending.[45] Some felt its Emmy Awards marked a cultural shift in relation to portrayal of lesbianism,[46] or proof of concept that works dealing with LGBT characters need not be tragic.[47] ""San Junipero"" has also been cited as an example of bisexual lighting, in which neon pink and deep blue â€“ the colours on the bisexual pride flag â€“ represent bisexual characters.[48] Amelia Perrin of Cosmopolitan criticised that this and the episode's nightclub setting reinforce a stereotype of bisexuality as ""a 'phase' or something experimental"".[49]

The episode's plot raises many philosophical questions, including the nature of consciousness and experience and the consequences of digitally simulated existence,[37][45][50] though these issues are not the episode's focus.[45] Reviewers have questioned what San Junipero would mean to believers in an afterlife,[45] and what would happen to its inhabitants in case of technical malfunctions.[50]

At the time of its release, ""San Junipero"" was Black Mirror's most popular episode among fans,[a] which has been attributed to its emotive presentation of a love story with a happy ending.[51][54] It has been favourably received by critics, garnering an approval from 92% of 25 critics on Rotten Tomatoes, and an average rating of 8/10. Critics' consensus on the website reads, ""Black Mirror delivers an uncharacteristically uplifting and enjoyable ending in ""San Junipero"", an especially bright and sweetly surprising episode that benefits greatly from its vibrant lead performances.""[55] The episode was rated five stars out of five in the Irish Independent[32] and an A in The A.V. Club.[41] Along with ""Nosedive"", Benjamin Lee of The Guardian gave the episode four stars,[3] while The Telegraph gave ""San Junipero"" three stars.[56] It has been described by critics as one of the ""best hours""[41] and one of the ""most beautiful, cinematic episodes"" of television in 2016.[57]

Mbatha-Raw's and Davis's performances were universally praised.[b] Sims lauded the couple's chemistry and said the pair concisely communicate ""a whole lifetime of angst and desires"".[44] Mullane commented that the strong acting keeps the audience interested prior to the plot twist.[59] Caitlin Welsh of Junkee complimented the ""understated, pitch-perfect"" performances for making the characters' relationship feel genuine.[60] Mbatha-Raw and Davis were praised for their emotional range,[3] for giving ""fierce and vulnerable performances"",[61] and for anchoring the episode.[62][63]

Mbatha-Raw and Davis also received praise in negative reviews. Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph criticised the characters' dialogue but praised that the ending is emotional due to Mbatha-Raw's ""vivacity and conviction"".[56] Aubrey Page of Collider reviewed that the episode is unoriginal, but this is compensated by the perfect casting and emotion of the acting.[64] However, Andrew Wallenstein of Variety criticised Mbatha-Raw and Davis for an inability to ""pack the emotional punch"" needed for the episode to stand out.[63]

The episode's plot twist, revealing that San Junipero is a simulated reality, was commended by critics. Pat Stacey of Irish Independent called the twist ""ingenious""[32] while Louisa Mellor of Den of Geek described it as ""captivating"".[37] Adam Chitwood of Collider noted that there is more to the episode than its twist and praised Harris for how the story unfolds.[5] Similarly, Alex Mullane of Digital Spy said the developments in the story are ""refreshing"" as they are not presented as twists.[59] Handlen liked how the episode finds a balance between revealing information and making the audience care about the characters.[41]

The episode's visual style and music, which evoke the 1980s, were well received. IndieWire praised both the production design and soundtrack.[58] Mullane called Mansell's score ""wonderfully tender"".[59] The Wrap reviewers said that the episode was ""visually stunning"" and its nostalgia for the 80s was ""joyous"".[65]

Many critics admired the emotion the episode evokes, and how it ventured into a new genre for the show. Corey Atad of Esquire and Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter both opined that the story would leave viewers in tears,[62][66] and Adam David of CNN Philippines cried whilst watching it.[31] Stacey found the episode ""extremely moving"".[32] Scott Meslow of GQ called it ""breathtakingly and tear-jerkingly human"".[67] Lee was surprised by the episode's poignancy,[3] while Mellor wrote that it is ""genuinely moving"".[37] Mullane said the episode demonstrated that the show can tell stories without a dark tone,[59] and Jacob Hall of /Film concurred.[68] Wallenstein called the episode ""satisfyingly daring"", although he ranked it poorly in comparison to other episodes.[63]

The episode has also received negative criticism from a minority of critics. Collin noted that the episode's central conceit has been widely used within the science fiction genre.[56] Stolworthy criticised the third act as ""overloaded"" and commented that ""San Junipero"", rather than ""Hated in the Nation"", should have been 90 minutes long.[42]

""San Junipero"" appeared on many critics' rankings of the 23 instalments in the Black Mirror series, from best to worst.



Following the fifth series, Brian Tallerico of Vulture rated Mbatha-Raw's performance the fourth best of Black Mirror.[75] Additionally, Proma Khosla of Mashable ranked the 22 Black Mirror instalments excluding Bandersnatch by tone, concluding that ""San Junipero"" is the second-least pessimistic episode of the show after ""Hang the DJ"".[76]

The episode also appears on critics' rankings of the 19 episodes from series 1 to series 4:

In August 2017, Brooker said there were no plans for a sequel episode to ""San Junipero"". He told the Los Angeles Times that ""we want to keep [Kelly and Yorkie] happy there"".[11] In an interview with NME, Brooker mentioned that some ideas for the episode were later removed, such as a scene with a kindergarten in San Junipero that ""felt like a whole world in and of itself"".[15] He raised the idea of doing a sequel in ""a completely different form"", such as a graphic novel or ""an experience"".[19][94] ""San Junipero"" has been alluded to through Easter eggs in subsequent episodes: for example, ""Black Museum"" shows Kelly's and Yorkie's dresses on display in a museum,[95] and features a hospital named Saint Juniper's.[96]


"
Men Against Fire,"

""Men Against Fire"" is the fifth and penultimate episode of the third series of British science fiction anthology series Black Mirror. Written by series creator and showrunner Charlie Brooker and directed by Jakob Verbruggen, it premiered on Netflix on 21 October 2016, together with the rest of series three.

The episode follows Stripe (Malachi Kirby), a soldier who hunts humanoid mutants known as roaches. After a malfunctioning of his MASS, a neural implant, he discovers that these ""roaches"" are ordinary human beings. In a fateful confrontation with the psychologist Arquette (Michael Kelly), Stripe learns that the MASS alters his perception of reality. The episode was first conceived under the name ""Inbound"" in 2010. Its storyline shifted over time, influenced by Brooker reading Men Against Fire by S.L.A. Marshall and On Killing by Dave Grossman.

The episode received mixed critical reception. Positive reviews praised Kirby and Kelly's acting as well as the relevance of the episode in a time of rising xenophobia in Europe and America. Other critics found the plot twist predictable and remarked that the storyline relied too heavily on cliches. Critical commentary frequently notes parallels to Nazi Germany. ""Men Against Fire"" was ranked poorly against other Black Mirror episodes by reviewers.

""Stripe"" Koinange (Malachi Kirby) and ""Hunter"" Raiman (Madeline Brewer) are squadmates in a military that hunts roachesâ€”pale, snarling, humanoid monsters with sharp teeth. Each soldier has a neural implant called MASS that provides data via augmented reality. Stripe and Hunter's squad searches a farmhouse while squad leader Medina (Sarah Snook) interrogates the owner, a devout Christian (Francis Magee). Stripe discovers a nest of roaches, one of whom points an LED device at Stripe; unfazed, he shoots one roach dead and stabs another to death. Medina arrests the owner and the squad burns down the farmhouse.

Stripe is rewarded with an erotic dream following his kills, but his MASS glitches during it. After further malfunctions the following day, Stripe has his MASS tested and consults a psychologist, Arquette (Michael Kelly), but neither visit reveals any problems.

The next day, Medina, Stripe and Hunter arrive at an abandoned housing complex. After a roach-sniper suddenly kills Medina, the other two soldiers enter the building as the sniper shoots at them. Stripe encounters a woman and urges her to flee, but Hunter shoots her dead. Stripe finds another woman (Ariane Labed) with her child, and Hunter prepares to shoot them. Stripe intervenes and wrestles Hunter, knocking her unconscious as she shoots him in the stomach. Stripe gets up and escapes with the mother and son.

They reach a cave in the woods where the woman, named Catarina, explains that the MASS implant alters soldiers' senses to show people of her ethnic group as inhuman ""roaches"". They are victims of a genocide justified by the military as genetic cleansing. While laypeople see the group as they are, they treat them as inferior due to propaganda. Hunter arrives and kills Catarina and her son Alec, then knocks Stripe unconscious.

Stripe awakens in a cell, where Arquette apologises for his MASS glitch, caused by the LED device. Arquette reveals that MASS alters soldiers' senses so they can kill without hesitation or remorse, and that Stripe consented to this when he enlisted before having his memory wiped. Stripe has the choice to allow his MASS and memory to be reset, or to be imprisoned. Arquette forces Stripe to rewatch the sensory feed of his farmhouse raid, where he now sees himself gruesomely killing people.

In the final scene, Stripe, now a decorated officer, approaches the house from his erotic dreams. He has tears streaming down his face as he smiles. The house is then shown to be a dilapidated empty home.

Whilst series one and two of Black Mirror were shown on Channel 4 in the UK, in September 2015 Netflix commissioned the series for 12 episodes (split into two series of six episodes).[2] In March 2016, Netflix outbid Channel 4 for the rights to distributing the third series, with a bid of $40 million.[3] Due to its move to Netflix, the show had a larger budget than in previous series.[4] ""Men Against Fire"" is the fifth episode of the third series;[5] all six episodes in this series were released on Netflix simultaneously on 21 October 2016. As Black Mirror is an anthology series, each episode is standalone.[6]

The titles of the six episodes that make up series 3 were announced in July 2016, along with the release date.[7] A trailer for series three, featuring an amalgamation of clips and sound bites from the six episodes, was released by Netflix on 7 October 2016.[8]

The episode was written by series creator Charlie Brooker. Originally called ""Inbound"", the first draft was inspired by the 2010 documentary The War You Don't See, which featured lengthy stories from victims of the Iraq War. In ""Inbound"", an attack on Britain appeared to be from an alien force, but was later revealed to be an invasion by Norway. It was the second script pitched in 2010 for the first series of Black Mirror, but it was rejected at the time. Influenced by Men Against Fire: The Problem of Battle Command by S.L.A. Marshall and On Killing by Dave Grossman, the episode's focus gradually shifted to a war where combat is censored to soldiers, and it was renamed ""Men Against Fire"".[1]

The title of the episode comes from Brigadier General S.L.A. Marshall's book Men Against Fire: The Problem of Battle Command (1947), wherein Marshall claims that during World War II, over 70% of soldiers did not fire their rifles, even under immediate threat, and most of those who fired aimed above the enemy's head.[9] A similar statement is made during one of Arquette's dialogues in the episode.[10] TheWrap later reported that there have been suggestions that Marshall's claim is incorrect.[11] For research, Brooker also read Dave Grossman's book On Killing, which is about the psychology of killing and based on Marshall's work.[12][10] He initially wrote Arquette as more ""stuffy"", though his character was always intended to be sympathetic. He is a father figure to some of the soldiers, and thinks his actions are good.[1]

Jakob Verbruggen directed the episode.[1] Malachi Kirby, a fan of the programme, was cast as Stripe. Kirby played the character as naive, vulnerable and with a sense of doubt, rather than as an alpha male.[1] Michael Kelly plays psychologist Arquette, having previously worked with Verbruggen on the American political thriller House of Cards. Kelly believed that Arquette and Doug Stamperâ€”his character on House of Cardsâ€”had a commonality of ""true convictions in their actions"". He suggested that Arquette thinks his actions help soldiers cope with posttraumatic stress disorder.[13]

The episode was filmed in 18 days. He was inspired by the ""fearless high energy"" of the 1997 science fiction film Starship Troopers. Though intended to look ""gritty"" and foreign, perhaps in an Eastern European setting, the production was constrained to the United Kingdom for economy of time and budget. Two locations near London were used for filming: the first was a disused army barracks, and the second was a set constructed in the forest for use as the village setting. A farmhouse was used as the ""roach nest"".[1]

As the roaches were to be shown close up to the camera, their design was considered in detail. Their clothing was ill-fitted, to look like it had been taken from villages. After looking at the effects of skin diseases and mutations, production designer Joel Collins conceived of a design in which their brains and features had swelling, as if they had hydrocephalus. Kristyan Mallett worked on prosthetics, and four designs were tested on camera. The actors required hours in make-up for prosthetics. Adult actors were given black contact lenses, while the eyes of a young boy featured were altered using visual effects in post-production. As the story only made sense if the fight scene in the farmhouse was shown from a soldier's point of view, the scene was shot in a frantic style, and roaches appeared more human-like when viewed from behind.[1]

Body doubles were used for the effect of Stripe seeing three copies of his fiancÃ©e as his MASS malfunctions during a dream.[1] Kelly's two scenes were filmed across three days, the latter being a lengthy scene where Stripe and Arquette are alone in a cell together. Kelly spent the second day thoroughly rehearsing this scene repeatedly, and it was filmed on the third day.[13] The room was chosen to be ""bright, uncomfortable and extremely claustrophobic"", and the two characters are never shown in the same frame; as Stripe learns information, the room feels like it closes in on him.[1]

Both Kelly and executive producer Annabel Jones compared the episode to what they saw as rising xenophobia in Europe and America, exemplified by media descriptions of refugees as ""swarms"" of people, the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign and Brexit coverage.[13][15] These comparisons were also made by critics:[16][17] Matt Patches of Thrillist summarised the episode as a ""catch-all metaphor for how we deal with the disenfranchised members of our global society"",[18] whilst Christian Holub of Entertainment Weekly described it as a ""thought-provoking parable about the military's role in genocide"".[14] Tristram Fane Saunders of The Telegraph believed compassion to be the message of the episode.[16]

The episode was described by reviewers as analogous to Nazi Germany and the Holocaust.[17][14][19] Sophie Gilbert of The Atlantic commented that the episode's depiction of eugenics links to ""prejudices still rife among humankind"" such as ""institutionalized racism, tribalism, and fear of refugees"".[20] Alissa Wilkinson of Vox found that the episode was about the past rather than the future, as it explores crimes against humanity from 20th century history.[19] Andrew Liptak of The Verge wrote that in the episode, the ""government perpetuated a holocaust by literally demonizing its enemies"".[21] Several reviewers noted that the villagers in the episode do not have the MASS system, so they see the genocide victims as they are, but still consider them ""roaches"".[17][19][20]

Verbruggen said that the ending, in which Stripe appears to come home to a beautiful house and fiancÃ©e, but then the house is seen to be empty and derelict, can be interpreted in different ways by the audience. Kirby suggested an interpretation where Stripe chooses to keep his memories, but enable the MASS system, so he knows his vision is a lie.[1] Kelly opined that Stripe had his memories wiped and that the house being empty is seen only by the viewers, not by Stripe.[13] Verbruggen questions whether any of the episode's events are real. Brooker called the ending ""oblique"", saying that he did not have an answer to what the ending meant. The ending was originally conceived of as a homecoming parade for the returning soldiers, which is revealed to not be real.[1]

""Men Against Fire"" has been compared to other works of science fiction. Alex Mullane of Digital Spy and Charles Bramesco of Vulture made comparisons with the 1997 satirical film Starship Troopers, for the soldiers' ""macho talk of ending the Roach menace"" and the work's ""thinly veiled commentary on the culture of virulence that warring nations have to cultivate"".[17][22] The episode was also described as the episode of Black Mirror most similar to The Twilight Zone, the anthology series which inspired it, for its focus on one simple parable.[16][14] Liptak compared the episode's narrative of a soldier realising the damage he is inflicting and going through a personal crisis to the military-related works ""Enemy Mine"", a 1979 novella, and Captain America: The Winter Soldier, a 2014 film.[21]

A Den of Geek article compares several real-world technologies to features of the MASS tool. Applied Research Associates' product ARC4 is an augmented reality headset designed for soldiers, whilst Waverly Labs has an app and earpiece translation tool designed for conversation, and a product ""iBand+"" in development claims it will be able to induce lucid dreaming.[23]

On Rotten Tomatoes, the episode received a rating of 59%, based on 22 reviews, with a critics' consensus approving of ""high production and a disquieting conclusion"" but disapproving of ""a blunt central theme that many viewers may find too on the nose to sustain an episode"".[5] The episode received an Aâˆ’ rating by Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club,[24] a Bâˆ’ grade from Christian Holub of Entertainment Weekly[14] and a score of three out of five stars in Tristram Fane Saunder's review for The Telegraph.[16] Roxanne Sancto of Paste praised the episode as ""incredibly fucking relevant""[25] and Gilbert said it was ""one of the better episodes of the series"",[20] but Matt Fowler of IGN wrote that it was the ""least engaging emotionally"" in the third series[26] and Adam Chitwood of Collider criticised it as ""heavy-handed with its social commentary"".[27] Both Liptak and Bramesco believed the concepts to be interesting, but executed poorly.[21][22] However, Handlen praised the episode's pacing.[24]

The plot twist was widely considered to be predictable,[22][24][27] leading Wilkinson and Mullane to say that the episode was not shocking[17][19] and Wilkinson to say that it lacked tension.[19] However, Gilbert described the twist as ""terrific"" and ""unexpected"", praising its plausibility.[20] Handlen described the ending of the episode as ""slightly unclear"", albeit symbolically ""effective"".[24] Saunders enjoyed the scene with Stripe and Arquette alone in a cell, commenting that them ""discussing ideas of right and wrong"" was ""by far the finest part of the episode"".[16]

Kirby and Kelly were both praised for their performances as Stripe and Arquette, respectively.[17][20] Handlen noted that Stripe is a passive character, and opined that Kirby did a good job in keeping ""our interest and our sympathies"" throughout the episode.[24] Bramesco believed that Kirby's performance introduced ""a grounded component worthy of the audience's emotional investment"" to the episode.[22] Gilbert praised that Kelly ""imbues every performance with extraordinary menace"".[20] Sancto praised the scene in which Stripe and Catarinaâ€”the mother labelled as a ""roach""â€”converse.[25]

The episode was criticised for overreliance on cliches, particularly those relating to the military and dystopic science fiction.[21][14] Saunders wrote that the episode's portrayal of the military was ""competent and familiar, rather than fresh or exciting"".[16] Bramesco said the episode was too much of a ""simplistic metaphor"" and ""doesn't offer anything new"".[22] Mullane wrote that there are ""a few shots where the boom mic slips into frame, which is an uncharacteristically sloppy distraction"".[17] Bramesco opined that the episode was ""gratuitously violent"".[22]

For their work on this episode, Kristyan Mallett and Tanya Lodge were nominated for a 2017 Make-Up Artists and Hair Stylists Guild award, in the category of Best Special Makeup Effects â€“ Television Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television.[28]

""Men Against Fire"" appeared on many critics' rankings of the 23 instalments in the Black Mirror series, from best to worst.



IndieWire authors ranked the 22 Black Mirror instalments excluding Bandersnatch by quality, giving ""Men Against Fire"" a position of 18th.[37] Additionally, Proma Khosla of Mashable ranked the same instalments by tone, concluding that ""Men Against Fire"" was the eighth most bleak.[38] Eric Anthony Glover of Entertainment Tonight ranked the episode 15th out of the 19 episodes from series one to four.[39]

Other critics ranked the 13 episodes in Black Mirror's first three series.

Some critics ranked the six episodes from series three of Black Mirror in order of quality.
"
Hated in the Nation,"

""Hated in the Nation"" is the sixth and final episode in the third series of the British science fiction anthology series Black Mirror. Written by series creator and showrunner Charlie Brooker and directed by James Hawes, it premiered on Netflix on 21 October 2016, along with the rest of series three. It is the longest episode of Black Mirror, at 89 minutes.

A Nordic noir-inspired episode, ""Hated in the Nation"" follows Detectives Karin Parke (Kelly Macdonald) and Blue Coulson (Faye Marsay) as they investigate a spate of deaths targeting the subjects of social media hatred, at the hands of Autonomous Drone Insects (ADIs) that have been deployed to combat environmental catastrophe as bees near extinction. It was filmed largely in London.

Informed by Brooker's experience of receiving hate mail after writing a 2004 Guardian column that disparaged George W. Bush, the episode drew comparison to The X-Files and explored themes including government surveillance and environmentalism. Across mostly positive reviews, critics praised the acting but gave mixed comments on the story and episode's length. It received middling rankings on Black Mirror instalments by quality.

Before a public inquiry, London Detective Chief Inspector Karin Parke (Kelly Macdonald) explains her role investigating the death of Jo Powers (Elizabeth Berrington), a controversial far-right journalist found dead after writing a widely condemned column that derided a self-immolating disability rights activist. Parke works with Trainee Detective Constable Blue Coulson (Faye Marsay) and Nick Shelton (Joe Armstrong). Powers' hospitalised husband claims that she cut her own throat with a wine bottle. Parke and Coulson talk to a primary school teacher who sent Powers a cake with ""fucking bitch"" iced on it. She tweeted ""#DeathTo @JoPowersWriter"", but denies violent intent.

The next day, the rapper Tusk (Charles Babalola)â€”attacked on social media after insulting a child fanâ€”has a seizure and dies in an MRI machine as its magnetic field pulls a metallic object out of his brain, through his eye socket. The object is an autonomous drone insect (ADI), created by Granular and deployed by the government to replace near-extinct bees. An ADI is found in Powers' brain, also. Parke and Coulson talk to Rasmus Sjoberg (Jonas Karlsson) at Granular and find an ADI with odd behaviour. Shaun Li (Benedict Wong) begins work on the case on behalf of the National Crime Agency (NCA).

Coulson finds #DeathTo was started by spambots posting a ""Game of Consequences"" video, where the most-mentioned person with the hashtag each day will be killed. Currently top is Clara Meades (Holli Dempsey), who posed for an inappropriate photo at a war memorial. Meades is taken to a safe house. Granular lose control of all ADIs, which surround the house. Parke and Coulson try to protect Meades, but an ADI infiltrates and kills her.

Coulson deduces that the ADIs use facial recognition and Sjoberg reveals that the government use them to surveil citizens. Meanwhile, the public and news media realise the consequences of #DeathTo. The most-mentioned person is now Chancellor Tom Pickering (Ben Miles). Parke interviews ex-Granular employee Tess Wallander (Georgina Rich) and learns that she was found attempting suicide by colleague Garrett Scholes (Duncan Pow) after receiving online hate. Scholes' manifesto is found, containing a geotagged image. A raid on this location yields Scholes' hacking toolkit. As Coulson discovers a file of IMEI numbers of everyone who used #DeathTo, Li forces Sjoberg to deactivate the system. This fails and triggers the ADIs to kill the 387,036 people who used the hashtag.

Concluding her evidence, Parke indicates that Coulson is believed dead by suicide. However, she later receives a text from Coulson, who has tracked Scholes down in an unnamed country.

Whilst series one and two of Black Mirror were shown on Channel 4 in the UK, in September 2015 Netflix commissioned the series for twelve episodes (split into two series of six episodes).[2] In March 2016, Netflix outbid Channel 4 for the rights to distributing the third series, with an offer of $40Â million.[3] Due to its move to Netflix, the show had a larger budget than in previous series.[4] ""Hated in the Nation"" is the sixth and final episode of the third series;[5] all six episodes in the series were released on Netflix simultaneously on 21 October 2016. As Black Mirror is an anthology series, each instalment can be watched in any order.[6]

The episode was written by series creator Charlie Brooker. The initial idea was for characters to vote for an individual to be killed by a robotâ€”a concept also used to shape the series four episode ""Metalhead"".[1] ""Hated in the Nation"" took inspiration from Scandinavian noir thriller television series such as The Killing.[8] Brooker found the episode difficult to write; he had previously written a spoof police procedural television series A Touch of Cloth but had not written serious works in the genre. After writing half of the script, the episode was put to one side and Brooker began working on other series three episodes. When he came back to the script, he decided to introduce the framing device of the inquiry to speed up exposition. Garrett Scholes was written to be mysterious, his character being inspired by terrorists Ted Kaczynskiâ€”nicknamed the Unabomberâ€”and Anders Behring Breivik.[1]

The script was also informed by Jon Ronson's book So You've Been Publicly Shamed (2015), about online shaming and its historical antecedents, and hate mail addressed to the comedian Stewart Lee over Jerry Springer: The Opera.[7][9] Brooker had personal experience of a public backlash after mentioning attempted and successful presidential assassins in a satirical 2004 Guardian article about then-U.S. president George W. Bush (he wrote: ""John Wilkes Booth, Lee Harvey Oswald, John Hinckley Jr, where are you now that we need you?"").[7][10][11] After many violent messages were sent to Brooker, he apologised and The Guardian removed the article from their website.[12] The experience informed the dialogue in the episode which compares online shaming to weather, in Brooker's words ""like there's this [...] ominous ion cloud hanging over you, and rather like a mental illness"". However, the experience was prior to the formation of Twitter; Brooker said that around 2013 he sensed a change in public opinion over the identification of social media as a toxic environment.[9]

James Hawes directed the episode. He focused on pacing the escalation as the scope of the storyline changed from local to global, also choosing a limited colour palette to match the episode's genre. ""Hated in the Nation"" is a near-future story set and filmed in London, the production encompassing 32 locations and taking place over 23 days. The headquarters of Granular was shot on five locations. Faye Marsay played Blue Coulson, having auditioned for a part in series three episode ""Men Against Fire"". Kelly Macdonald starred as DCI Karin Parke. The episode's climax takes place in the safe house and was filmed over three days. The ending was filmed in Gran Canaria, as production time was too limited to shoot in the tropics. It originally featured a shot of Blue putting a knife in her bag.[1] The soundtrack was credited to Martin Phipps, while the closing song was composed by Alev Lenz.[13][14]

Work on the graphics and social media interfaces of the episode was extensive, as this was key to the narrative. The company Painting Practice worked on the design of the robotic bees, which needed to be recognisable as bees but also have a creepy aspect to them.[1] At 89 minutes in length, ""Hated in the Nation"" is the longest episode of Black Mirror.[15] Splitting the episode into two parts was considered but as the programme is an anthology series and series three would be the first to premiere on Netflix, it was kept as one episode.[1]

""Hated in the Nation"" is a police procedural and a work of detective fiction.[14][16] Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, found that it ""follows the standard beats of the cop series practically to the letter"".[16] Because of its length and tone, Collider's Adam Chitwood wrote that it ""feels very much like a feature film of sorts"".[15] The episode was widely compared by critics to the 1990s science-fiction drama series The X-Files, which used bees as a recurring theme.[17][18] Emily VanDerWerff of Vox wrote that The X-Files' trope of one detective being a ""believer"" and their colleague a ""skeptic"" was adapted to Blue being ""tech-savvy"" and Karin being a ""virtual Luddite"".[18] Alex Mullane of Digital Spy instead drew comparison to the films Minority Report (2002) and I, Robot (2004), as each features a detective investigating murder in the context of a science-fiction world.[14]

With The Verge's Lizzie Plaugic identifying a theme of cyberbullying, the episode explores the lack of consequences that social media users face for their words, and the effect that those words have on others.[14][15][19] Screen Rant's Marian Phillips used the term ""cancel culture"" to describe this situation.[20] Mullane wrote that Jo Powers was a ""not-terribly-subtle"" take on Katie Hopkins, a controversial British commentator. Mullane found that the episode does not show Powers positively, but also criticises ""the manner in which people rally against such figures"".[14] Plaugic saw the preschool teacher who sent Powers hate mail as illustrative of how people's social media presences can be ""completely disconnected from their lives"".[19] Handlen saw it fitting that Scholes was ""a bit of a nothing"" character, as the episode ""stresses the power of anonymity"".[16] VanDerWerff thought that Scholes could be viewed as a self-insertion by Brooker, the character ""full of outlandishly grand ideas"" and forcing others to ""consider the darker side of technology"".[18] Rob Leane wrote in Den of Geek that accounts in So You've Been Publicly Shamed were relevant to the episode, such as a woman whose career was significantly affected by a viral image of her swearing beside a military cemetery sign.[21] Brooker was asked if ""policing Twitter"" was a solution to issues identified by the episode and replied: ""I don't know the answer!"" He said that ""people should be more accountable"", but that it was ""difficult to see how you do that without the law getting involved"".[22]

Other topics include government surveillance and environmentalism.[14] David Sims of The Atlantic saw government surveillance to be ""a particularly prevalent concern in the U.K."" due to its scope.[17] In Variety, Sonia Saraiya linked the themes of social media and government surveillance in that ""both blur the divide between the public and private spheres"", and the episode explores whether either ""ends up making us more connected or safer"".[23] On the subject of environmentalism, Mullane saw the setting as a ""near-future in which species are regularly blinking out of existence due to climate change"" and ""human indifference"", among them bees.[14] Leane found that similar bee technologies had been piloted in the real world, including the RoboBee, which is designed for agriculture or disaster relief. Greenpeace has made recommendations that governments should invest in prevention of colony collapse disorder over such technologies.[21]

Allusions are made to previous episodes, largely through news tickers and trending topics on displayed social media screens. Blue says that she left forensics after seeing materials confiscated from Iain Rannoch, a child torturer and murderer from ""White Bear"". A news channel shown, UKN, appeared in previous episodes. A ticker announces the MASS technology from ""Men Against Fire"".[24] Another reports on a technology from ""White Christmas""â€”cookiesâ€”being ruled to have human rights, while a later ticker references ""Playtest"" character Shou Saito and ""White Bear"" character Victoria Skillane.[24][25] Trending social media topics reference a video game from ""Playtest"", the prime minister from ""The National Anthem"" and White Bear from the episode of the same name. The hashtag #DeathTo trends with Skillane and a ticker says that she attempts suicide in jail.[24] Waldo of ""The Waldo Moment"" is seen as a laptop sticker.[25]

The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, which gave the episode an average score of 80% based on 20 reviews, summarised that it ""concludes Black Mirror's third season on a strong note, effectively conveying the sometimes fatal consequences of online hate through a narrative that is morally complex and cinematically invigorating"".[5] The episode received ratings of 8.3 out of 10 in Paste, four out of five stars in Vulture and The Telegraph, an Aâˆ’ in Entertainment Weekly and a B+ in The A.V. Club.[13][16][26][27][28] Euan Ferguson of The Observer saw it as the best of the series three episodes, while Handlen thought it neither the best nor worst.[29][16] Chancellor Agard of Entertainment Weekly praised it as ""very strong"".[28] Some critics viewed the episode as too long, with Sims saying that it ""makes its point very repetitively"", though Mullane found that the episode was ""well-paced"" and ""didn't drag"".[14][17][18][28] Contrastingly, The Telegraph's Robbie Collin reviewed that Hawes used the runtime ""to give the moral complexities of Brooker's script the breathing space they deserve"".[13] Vulture's Charles Bramesco reviewed that there was ""agile movement between cerebral sci-fi and emotionally rooted moralizing"".[27] Handlen saw the episode as ""underdeveloped in some places"" and ""overdeveloped in others"".[16]

The cast received praise. Macdonald and Marsay received positive reception as Karin and Blue, respectively, with Agard writing that they ""just gave fantastic performances that complemented each other"".[14][18][28] Bramesco said that Macdonald ""lays claim to the episode's best lines"", having demonstrated much ""wry comedy"".[27] Wong as Li and Miles as Pickering were also praised.[14][18] Agard approved of Scholes being grounded by ""motivations in something personal"", though Plaugic saw his character as less interesting than an unexplored potential for the episode to show how #DeathTo participants act once realising its effects.[19][28] The soundtrack was also praised, with Collin praising Phipps' ""keening"" score and Mullane finding a composition by Lenz ""beautifully haunting"".[13][14]

The story received mixed commentary. VanDerWerff found that the ""full weight"" of Scholes' actions ""doesn't register as much as it could"", though praising the ""nasty"" twist and ""nicely inconclusive"" ending.[18] Handlen concurred that the episode ""downplays the massive deaths"" but dissented in finding that the ending does not give ""sufficient resolution"" for Scholes.[16] Plaugic believed that the episode ""never figures out exactly what it's critiquing"".[19] Agard was ""genuinely engaged with the story"",[28] while Bramesco praised the writing for a ""surprising facility for the stylized language of pulp crime novels"".[27] Ferguson found the episode ""clever"" and ""ripe with thought"".[29] Some minor details were criticised. Mullane thought it odd that no character attempted to block the air vent during the bee attack, when it seems that characters previously look at the vent, while VanDerWerff noted that the story remains in the U.K. despite the #DeathTo game not appearing to be limited to the country.[14][18]

""Hated in the Nation"" received mixed positions on many critics' rankings of the 23 instalments in the Black Mirror series, from best to worst.



IndieWire authors ranked the 22 Black Mirror instalments excluding Bandersnatch by quality, giving ""Hated in the Nation"" a position of 5th.[38] Eric Anthony Glover of Entertainment Tonight found the episode to be 11th-best of the 19 episodes from series one to four.[39] Additionally, Proma Khosla of Mashable ranked the same instalments by tone, concluding that ""Hated in the Nation"" was the third-most bleak.[40]

Other critics ranked the 13 episodes in Black Mirror's first three series.

Some critics ranked the six episodes from series three of Black Mirror in order of quality.
