Striking Vipers,"

""Striking Vipers"" is the first episode of the fifth series of the anthology series Black Mirror. It was written by series creator Charlie Brooker and directed by Owen Harris. The episode was released on Netflix, along with the rest of series five, on 5 June 2019.

The episode follows two old friends, Danny Parker (Anthony Mackie) and Karl Houghton (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), reconnecting over a virtual reality fighting game. They begin having virtual sex in the game, which affects Danny's marriage with Theo (Nicole Beharie). The episode has an all-black main cast and was filmed in Brazil. Its storyline arose from an idea about a workplace affair in virtual reality where neither co-worker knew the other's identity.

Critics identified fluidity of sexuality and gender, infidelity, love and friendship as major themes; the episode raises questions about whether Danny and Karl are gay and whether their relationship is infidelity. Reviewers were divided over whether it addressed these themes in an interesting way, and some found it inferior to series three's ""San Junipero"", which also shows a queer relationship in virtual reality. The acting and directing was mostly praised, though some critics found the characterisation lacking.

Twenty-seven-year-old Danny Parker (Anthony Mackie) and his girlfriend Theo (Nicole Beharie) go to a bar and pretend to be strangers. After they return home and have sex, Danny loudly plays the fictional fighting game Striking Vipers with his friend Karl Houghton (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) as their preferred characters Lance and Roxette, respectively. This wakes Theo up.

Eleven years later, Danny hosts a barbecue at his house with Theo, to whom he is married and has a five-year-old child. He has fallen out of contact with Karl, who is currently seeing a younger woman named Mariella. At the party, Karl gives Danny a birthday present: Striking Vipers X, the series' newest installment, and the virtual reality kit needed to play it. That night, the pair play the game in their respective homes, falling motionless in real life as they fully experience all sensations of Lance (Ludi Lin) and Roxette (Pom Klementieff). After a bout of fighting, which induces real pain, they fall onto each other. Karl (as Roxette) kisses Danny (as Lance), but Danny pulls away after a few seconds and they exit the game.

Over the next few weeks, Danny and Karl regularly have sex in the game in the characters' bodies, and Theo notices that Danny is becoming withdrawn and no longer has sex with her, even though they have been trying to have a baby. Theo confronts him on their wedding anniversary and asks if he is having an affair. Danny says he is not and tells Karl they need to stop playing the game.

At Danny's next birthday, Theo invites Karl to dinner as a surprise. Karl reveals to Danny that he has been unable to recreate the emotions or experiences with computer-controlled characters or other players. That night, the pair enter the game and have passionate sex. Afterwards, Karl says ""I love you"". Danny arranges for them to meet in real life and kiss in their normal bodies, but both of them say that there is no feeling there. Karl argues they should continue seeing each other in the game but Danny disagrees, and an ensuing fight is broken up by the police. Theo picks up Danny from the police station and is enraged at his silence about what caused the fight. Danny finally starts to admit the truth.

On July 14, as the three have agreed on an annual tradition, Danny plays Striking Vipers X with Karl while Theo goes to the bar without her wedding ring to meet a stranger.

A fifth series of Black Mirror was commissioned by Netflix in March 2018, three months after the release of series four.[1] Initially part of series five's production, the interactive work Black Mirror: Bandersnatch increased in scope to the point where it was separated from the series and released as a standalone film; it premiered on 28 December 2018. Although previous series of the programme produced under Netflix contained six episodes, series five comprises three episodes, as the series creator Charlie Brooker viewed this as preferable to making viewers wait longer for the next series.[2] The three episodes—""Striking Vipers"", ""Smithereens"" and ""Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too""—were released on Netflix simultaneously on 5 June 2019.[3] As Black Mirror is an anthology series, each instalment can be watched in any order.[4] ""Striking Vipers"" was filmed before Bandersnatch.[5]

The episode was written by Brooker, alongside the executive producer Annabel Jones. The initial concept was for an office cohort to spend time in a virtual reality simulation as part of a team-building exercise, where they would prepare to perform the musical Grease. As part of the exercise, each employee's identity within the simulation would be unknown. The idea was conceived for two of the employees to have an affair within the simulation.[6] This story changed over time, and was informed by another source of inspiration: Brooker was reflecting on his days of playing the fighting game Tekken with flatmates in the 1990s, and thought there was something interesting in the ""homoerotic"" and ""weirdly primal"" nature of the situation.[7] He thought that neighbours could confuse their gaming sessions for a sex dungeon based on the noises they made.[6][7][8] During the writing of ""Striking Vipers"", a variety of fighting games were used for reference, including Dead or Alive, a series where the characters have sexually provocative appearances.[9]

Pornography was a theme discussed by the writers. Jones said the episode relates to the question of ""when porn stops being a healthy distraction and actually becomes an affair"".[6] The name ""Striking Vipers"", which alludes to snakes and perhaps sexual imagery, was chosen by Brooker to sound like a plausible game title.[8] During the writing process, he nicknamed it ""Man Junipero"", in reference to the series three episode ""San Junipero"".[6] Brooker was conflicted as to whether the relationship between Danny and Karl is accurately described as a gay relationship, saying that it is also about male friendship and the barriers to communication between men.[8] Jones noted that Danny's character regains a younger physique by entering the game, saying that there was a broader theme about ageing and ""finding your identity when you don't have those staples that you've grown up with"".[9]

In regards to the real-life kiss Danny and Karl share, Brooker thought the characters were telling the truth about experiencing a lack of excitement, but that it was different within the virtual reality game. Jones said that Danny feels relieved by the information he gets from the kiss, as he may be able to retain a stability in his marriage, but Karl feels worried over what implications it has for their virtual reality relationship. The final arrangement Theo, Danny and Karl have occurs once per year. Brooker and Jones saw this ending as both pragmatic and romantic. Jones said that Theo needs ""to feel excited and loved"", Danny needs ""escapism and wish-fulfilment"" and that Karl is ""quite isolated"", though the arrangement is ""enough to sustain him"".[9] Brooker similarly commented that Karl's predicament is ""the most bleak"", while Danny and Theo's marriage ""has actually been strengthened"" by the arrangement—specifically, by their newfound communication about ""their fantasies and needs"". He saw the ending as ambiguous, rather than unreservedly happy.[5]

""Striking Vipers"" was the third Black Mirror episode to be directed by Owen Harris, after series two's ""Be Right Back"", and series three's ""San Junipero"".[10] The episode has an all-black main cast, with Anthony Mackie as Danny, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Karl and Nicole Beharie as Theo.[11] Beharie was a big fan of the show prior to her appearance.[12] Within Striking Vipers X, Danny plays as Lance—portrayed by Ludi Lin—and Karl plays as Roxie—acted by Pom Klementieff. By coincidence, four of the actors played major roles in superhero films—Mackie was Falcon, Klementieff was Mantis, Abdul-Mateen was Black Manta and Lin was the Black Ranger in Power Rangers.[13] Though the script originally called for a suburban England setting, it is set in America.[10] It was filmed in São Paulo, Brazil, from 18 March to 18 April 2018. The production company registered 19 locations for filming and 150 production staff. For example, the final scene of the episode shows a Striking Vipers X scene on top of a skyscraper, shot near the Edifício Copan, with a former Hilton Hotel made to look disused with computer-generated imagery.[14][15]

Harris found it interesting that the bromance had not been subverted often in fiction, and enjoyed the question of whether society's views on monogamy and marriage might change, like how attitudes to dating changed with the prevalence of dating apps. Harris said that the episode had a dark humour, and one of the lines which helped him understand it was Karl's ""I fucked a polar bear and I still couldn't get you out of my mind"", which became oft-repeated by fans.[10] Mackie said that the filming of the scene with that line ""took probably an hour longer than it was supposed to"" because of how amusing the actors found it.[16] When asked about fans, Mackie said that those who approached him would either be interested in a long conversation about the themes of the episode, or make homophobic and uninformed comments about it.[16]

Mackie said that love was the important idea in the episode, and that the crew spoke about ""what it means for people to truly care about each other"". The script was written without the race of the male characters in mind. Commenting that masculinity in the black community was a contemporary discussion point, Mackie recalled that Harris talked with him very early on about the relevance of race to the characters.[16] In response to whether Karl was gay, Harris said that sexuality is a spectrum ""far broader and more complex"" than ""black and white"".[10] Abdul-Mateen thought that Karl felt ""understood and ... seen by Danny"" and that it was this that he found attractive in the relationship. He said that Karl feels loneliness underneath his external personality.[11] Abdul-Mateen made it ambiguous whether Karl was suppressing his sexuality or was simply finding himself in a new situation, and said that they ""didn't want to define exactly"" what underpinned Danny and Karl's relationship.[17]

Jones said of Danny and Karl's real-life kiss that both actors aimed to be clear that the excitement from Striking Vipers X was ""not being echoed in the real world"", and that the characters were relieved by this.[18] Abdul-Mateen thought the scene was important in its depiction of two black men with ""a vessel to explore their sexuality and to understand who they are"".[11] Describing the filming, he said that ""shooting in the rain is never easy"" and estimated it took three to four hours.[17] Harris saw the ending as ""pragmatic"": they considered showing more details about whether the arrangement was succeeding in practice, but chose to leave the ambiguity.[10] Abdul-Mateen noted that Karl has a cat at the end of the episode, which means ""he has something to take care of"". He thought it could imply that Karl has matured, but is still lonesome.[17]

The episode is a romance, where Danny, Karl and Theo are in a love triangle.[19][20][21] Dan Stubbs of NME and Jim Vorel of Paste characterised it as a ""spiritual sequel"" to ""San Junipero"".[22][23] Stubbs saw that as in ""San Junipero"", the episode ""finds the beauty and ugliness in a new form of romance"".[22] Writing for Vox, Alex Abad-Santos compared that in ""San Junipero"", Kelly and Yorkie ""play semi-artificial, digital-only versions of themselves"", like Danny and Karl.[24] Stubbs and Wired's Matt Reynolds found that in ""Striking Vipers"", the technology is not the focus of the episode—instead its implications and the human stories are.[22][25] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club analysed that the episode has humour but it is ""never designed to undercut the emotional development of the characters"".[26] Sexual and gender fluidity, infidelity and love and friendship are major themes, with The Guardian's Lucy Mangan writing that ""every boundary is porous"".[27][28] Critics identified a large number of questions posed by the episode. Louisa Mellor wrote in Den of Geek that the episode initially asks about Danny and Karl's sexual activity: ""Is it cheating? Porn? Love?"" It also asks if they are gay or bisexual.[29] Commenting in Wired, Victoria Turk viewed the episode as making a case that engaging in virtual reality porn is infidelity.[25] Tasha Robinson, a reviewer for The Verge, said that Karl's attempts to persuade Danny to keep the relationship going is ""needy and manipulative"" and characteristic of an ""imbalanced relationship"", with Karl going back and forth between ""defending their virtual trysts as meaningless fun"" and ""claiming they mean everything and are worth any risk"".[30]

Critics explored the implications of Danny and Karl's relationship. Vorel wondered whether it was a romantic or physical connection, how Karl's choice to play a woman related to his masculinity, and whether there would still be attraction if Danny and Karl swapped characters. He called the pair ""two alpha males"" who feel ""shock and embarrassment"" when made to confront their sexualities.[23] Michael Ahr of Den of Geek suggested that the pair could be suppressing their homosexuality or ""indulging in the objectification of their avatars' hyper-sexualized appearances"".[28] Den of Geek's Alec Bojalad gave a partial answer that ""there is at least some homosexual energy"" but ""Roxette and Lance's bodies are an essential part of the equation"".[31] Bojalad found that despite uncertainty over their sexuality, Danny and Karl ""needed each other in ways they didn't fully understand because they didn't have the language for it"".[31] Abad-Santos suggested that Karl enjoys ""letting Danny take control sexually"". He also recalled playing Chun-Li in Street Fighter II, the only female character, as did lots of gay children because it gave them ""the freedom to be someone ... who [they] could never be"".[24] Handlen said that Karl could be interpreted as a ""potentially closeted trans woman ... but the text stops short of suggesting he's going to make any steps towards transitioning or understanding himself better"".[26] Vorel reviewed that the episode ""chooses not to judge its characters"", while The Atlantic's David Sims said it ""withholds answers for most of the questions"".[20][23]

Some reviewers drew meaning from the technological aspect of Danny and Karl's relationship. Sims analysed that the episode raises questions about ""how sexuality on the internet is continuing to evolve"".[20] Stubbs queried whether the ""meat person or the avatar"" is the real version of us, when ""we spend our leisure time in a virtual world and our real lives wearing our work masks"". He also suggested that a ""virtual/real life balance"" could be as fundamental as a work–life balance.[22] Hugh Montgomery, writing for the BBC, found a ""pornographic quality of computer game violence"" and Abad-Santos saw ""Striking Vipers"" as serving to connect ""video game addiction and porn addiction"" as well as ""violence and men's sexuality"".[24][32] Another perspective came from Bojalad, who wrote that the episode sees video games as ""a safe, consequence-free simulation space for little boys and eventually little men to work though the complex feelings they've so often ignored"".[31] Ahr similarly described that Striking Vipers X lets the characters ""shed their culturally ingrained male inhibitions and admit their devotion to each other in a way that society discourages in real life"".[28]

Critics found that Danny and Karl's sexual activity gave them what they were lacking in their real lives. According to Bojalad, Danny and Karl's younger selves have a ""classic and recognizable college student dynamic"".[31] Ahr wrote that the ""sudden"" time skip creates an ""atmosphere of disillusionment"", with a ""contrast between the party atmosphere of the intro and the mundane backyard barbecue"".[28] While Danny lives an ""idyllic suburban life"", as Stubbs put it, Vorel and Vulture's Charles Bramesco said he has a mid-life ennui.[22][23][33] His sex with Theo is for conception, not enjoyment.[29] In contrast, Stubbs called Karl a ""rich executive living the bachelor dream""; he fits the trope of a ""ladies' man"" and dates younger women.[22][24][29] Bojalad believed that Danny and Karl each wanted what the other person had: Karl's freedom or Danny's security.[31] Mellor wrote that Danny gets ""energy, abs, joint mobility"" and ""virility"" when playing Lance, which he has been deprived of through ageing and parenthood. Additionally, she wrote that Theo has a ""need for excitement in the desert of adult responsibility"".[29]

Some critics noted foreshadowing in the initial scenes, eleven years before the main story. Bojalad and Ahr both commented that Theo is aroused by Danny treating her like a stranger, a sign of her later desires to meet strangers at a bar.[28][31] Reynolds interpreted that the roleplay ""sets up this idea that the desire to be someone a little different is a completely human thing"".[25] Additionally, Karl's mock-humping of Danny while playing Striking Vipers was seen by Bramesco to indicate homoerotic tension.[33] Ahr stated that early on, Theo tells Danny he should talk ""more openly and frequently"" to Karl, and communication between them is a central tension in the episode.[28] The episode also makes reference to other Black Mirror instalments: it shows products made by SaitoGemu, of ""Playtest"", and TCKR, of ""San Junipero""; and Karl's pinball machine has different gameplay modes that can be seen to reference locations from past episodes.[34][35]

On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the episode holds an approval rating of 74% based on 38 reviews. The website summarises that critics found it ""well-produced and thought-provoking"", but that ""holding back its emotional punch"" makes it less powerful than similar episodes.[19] Out of five stars, the episode received ratings of five stars from the BBC, four stars in The Independent, two stars in The Telegraph and one star in Vulture.[21][32][33][36] It also attained a graded rating of an A in The A.V. Club.[26] In positive criticism, Stubbs said it was ""one of the most sensitive, emotionally affecting"" instalments, with Mangan concurring that it was ""one of the most tender"", and Vorel opined it to be ""among the series' most pitch-perfect achievements"".[22][23][27] Ahr wrote that it had a great ""level of literary merit, allowing for all sorts of analysis for those willing to plumb its depths"".[28] However, in The Telegraph, Ed Power panned the script as ""listless"".[36]

Critics identified various parts of the plot to be weak. Power criticised the occurrence of virtual reality ""as a plot device"" as overused in Black Mirror.[36] While Vorel saw Danny and Karl's reactions to be ""profoundly well-earned"", and Bojalad saw their sex scenes as ""surprisingly raw and powerful"", Bramesco did not see a ""foundation of desire"" leading to the first kiss.[23][31][33] Vorel and Robinson wanted further information about how or why people are using Striking Vipers X as a sex simulator, or why it was designed to have this functionality.[23][30] Contrastingly, Stubbs opined that the initial in-game scenes were ""incredibly funny"" and the rest were ""brilliant"".[22] Turk criticised Roxette's description of sex as ""the full orchestra"" for women to be ""awful"" and ""corny"", and Bramesco and the Digital Spy critics Ali Griffiths and Morgan Jeffery disliked Lance's ""don't feel like a gay thing"" line.[25][33][37] Sims said that the ending was ""odd"" and ""slightly melancholy"".[20] Turk thought Danny, Karl and Theo's once-a-year arrangement is a dated solution because it maintains Danny and Theo's ""traditional hetero monogamous marriage with two kids and an annual family barbecue"", rather than meaningfully integrating any change into it.[25] Similarly, Bramesco thought that the supposedly happy ending works by ""gracefully eliding"" every day of the year but one.[33]

Comparisons to ""San Junipero"" based on quality were largely unfavourable, such as that of The Guardian's Guy Lodge, who saw ""Striking Vipers"" as ""hollow by comparison"".[38] Reynolds thought that the episode's themes were ""explored in a more gripping way"" in ""San Junipero"".[25] Similarly, Bramesco reviewed the episode as a ""dunderheaded thought experiment"" which was like ""San Junipero"" but where ""everything that could have gone wrong ... does so"".[33] Sims found it ""nervier"" and ""less swooning"" than the other romance episodes, lacking the ""rebellious fun"" of ""San Junipero"" but also the ""tragic tinge"" of ""Be Right Back"" and ""Hang the DJ"".[20] Similarly, Power critiqued that ""San Junipero"" and ""Hang the DJ"" had ""something genuinely profound"" to say about love, but ""Striking Vipers"" does not. As such, only the former two episodes ""earned"" their happy ending.[36] Griffiths and Jeffery criticised that ""queerness is always neatly hidden away in virtual worlds"" in Black Mirror, both in ""San Junipero"" and ""Striking Vipers"". They stated that ""Striking Vipers"" did not address its themes deeply enough, such as by not showing on-screen the conversation Danny has where he confesses the situation to Theo.[37] However, Montgomery dissented, writing that ""Striking Vipers"" was similar to ""Be Right Back"" and ""San Junipero"" as three of ""the finest and most soulful"" episodes.[32]

Critics were divided on whether the episode addressed the questions it raises to a sufficient degree. Griffiths and Jeffery said that it ""never really gets to the crux of what it means for Danny to be attracted to Karl"" as Roxette, and does not show enough of Karl's perspective.[37] Lodge argued that there is a ""frustratingly regressive tone"" as the episode is ""embarrassed and coy about its subject matter"".[38] However, Turk said that ""enough was shown ... to raise the most interesting theme"": that Danny and Karl are attracted to each other only when Karl is a woman.[25] Vorel, Mellor and Robinson commented that the episode was surprisingly mature, with Bojalad summarising that it ""presents a stunning example of reckoning with technology and one's own wants and desires in a mature, adult fashion"".[23][29][30][31] Montgomery thought it was a good premise for the show as it is ""both technologically plausible and richly philosophical"".[32] Jon Paul of Syfy Wire found the topic of how black men ""struggle with the energy that comes with exploring intimacy"" and ""suppress themselves"" interesting, along with how men behave ""relatively distant and neutral"". He linked this to toxic masculinity.[39] Lodge criticised that ""queer desire is treated ... as a disorienting byproduct of alien technology rather than a matter of the heart"" and that the implications of Karl enjoying sexual experiences in a woman's body are ""glibly grazed over"".[38]

Some reviewers found the characterisation to be lacking. Reynolds wanted to ""understand the characters a little more"" and Handlen said the episode ""never quite gets under the surface"" of them.[25][26] Abad-Santos went further, saying that Danny and Karl seem to ""exist just to raise points and get us to the end of a thought-provoking argument, rather than as people in a meaningful story"".[24] Bramesco and Power said that, respectively, the pair had ""zero demonstrated chemistry"", and are not convincing with their ""supposed transcendent charge"".[33][36] In contrast, Fiona Sturges of The Independent praised the ""nuanced depiction of marriage, parenthood"" and their consequent ""erosion of spontaneity"", and Handlen saw Danny, Karl and Theo as being given ""a measure of dignity and compassion they might not have found on other shows"".[21][26]

Critical comments about the acting and directing were positive. Stubbs reviewed the all-black cast as further establishing Black Mirror as ""a bastion of diversity ... not as a box-ticking exercise"".[22] Handlen and Mellor found the performances ""solid"" and ""strong"", respectively, with Mellor praising Danny and Roxie in particular.[26][29] Handlen wrote that Abdul-Mateen ""is terrific as Karl, selling the character's charm and enthusiasm and just absolutely landing the heartbreak"".[26] Ahr said that Beharie's acting was ""as expressive as they come"".[28] Vorel also praised Mackie, Abdul-Mateen and Beharie.[23] Handlen praised Harris's direction, analysing that the shots often position Danny and Karl in ""traditional fighting game poses"".[26] Mellor and Sims praised the filming style and scenery of the in-game scenes, with the former commenting that Harris ""successfully created two totally different textures for each world"".[20][29]

""Striking Vipers"" ranked as follows on critics' lists of the 23 instalments of Black Mirror, from best to worst:



IndieWire authors ranked the 22 Black Mirror instalments excluding Bandersnatch by quality, giving ""Striking Vipers"" a position of 14th.[48] Instead of by quality, Proma Khosla of Mashable ranked the episodes by tone, concluding that ""Striking Vipers"" was the third-least pessimistic episode of the show.[49]

""Striking Vipers"" was nominated for three awards: an ADG Excellence in Production Design Award, a Golden Reel Award and a Producers Guild of America Award.[50][51][52]
"
Smithereens,"

""Smithereens"" is the second episode of the fifth series of the British science fiction anthology series Black Mirror. Written by series creator and showrunner Charlie Brooker and directed by James Hawes, it premiered on Netflix on 5 June 2019, alongside ""Striking Vipers"" and ""Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too"". In the episode, the rideshare driver Chris (Andrew Scott) takes hostage the intern Jaden (Damson Idris) of Smithereen, a large social media company, making a demand to contact the company's CEO Billy Bauer (Topher Grace).

The episode was inspired by an experience Brooker had in a car hired via Uber when the driver got out unexpectedly to get a bottle of water. He also began a story around how a person grieves the loss of a loved one differently when their life is permanently inscribed in social media. Smithereen is similar to the social media website Twitter and Bauer was compared to its CEO at the time, Jack Dorsey. Most filming took place in England, but Grace's scenes were filmed in Spain. Scenes were shot roughly in chronological order, at Scott's request, and his inability to drive was a challenge for the production.

The major theme in ""Smithereens"" is the power of social media companies and their products' negative attributes, including addictivity. Critical reception was mixed: Scott's acting received widespread praise and a nomination for a Primetime Emmy Award, but reviewers mostly criticised the episode's storyline and the simplicity of its message. It was ranked poorly in comparison to other Black Mirror instalments.

Chris Gillhaney (Andrew Scott) is a rideshare driver in London. He has sex with Hayley (Amanda Drew), a woman from his group therapy, who has been trying to guess the password to her late daughter's Persona account to find out what led to her suicide. One day, Chris picks up Jaden (Damson Idris), an employee at the social media company Smithereen. Chris abducts him at gunpoint but is furious upon discovering that he is a newly-joined intern. A police officer sees Jaden in the back seat with a bag over his head and pursues with her partner. In the chase, Chris veers to avoid two teenage cyclists and stalls the car in a field. An additional contingent of police arrive, led by CS Linda Grace (Monica Dolan).

Chris is aiming to speak with Smithereen CEO Billy Bauer (Topher Grace). Chris sends a picture of Jaden at gunpoint to Jaden's superior. Word gets to COO Penelope Wu (Ruibo Qian) in the U.S., who puts Chris on hold. However, Billy is on a solitary retreat. As police visit Chris's listed address, Smithereen gather much more information through Chris's social media profiles. Formerly a teacher, Chris lost his fiancée Tamsin in a car accident with a drunk driver three years earlier and has been planning a kidnapping for weeks. The hostage negotiator David Gilkes (Daniel Ings) speaks to Chris, but Chris has researched negotiator tactics and leverages the hostage so that David leaves.

Smithereen are recording Chris while he is on hold. Chris works this out by pretending that the gun is fake and noticing the police's changing behaviour and social media posts from bystanders. He threatens to shoot Jaden in five minutes unless Billy calls him; despite Penelope and the FBI's protestations, Billy does so. Talking to him, Chris reveals that he was checking a Smithereen notification when the cars collided and blames himself for the deaths. Chris and Billy agree that Smithereen has been designed to be as addictive as possible and Billy says he was planning to quit as CEO. Chris implies he will now kill himself, but Billy begs Chris to let him help. Chris thinks of a last favour: ask Persona to give Hayley her daughter's password.

Chris tries to release Jaden, who urges Chris not to attempt suicide and then fights to take his gun off him. At Grace's orders, snipers fire into the car as the pair struggle. Around the world, people check their phones, then continue on with their lives.

A fifth series of Black Mirror was commissioned by Netflix in March 2018, three months after the release of series four.[1] Initially part of series five's production, the interactive work Black Mirror: Bandersnatch increased in scope to the point where it was separated from the series and released as a standalone film; it premiered on 28 December 2018. Although previous series of the programme produced under Netflix contained six episodes, series 5 comprises three episodes, as series creator Charlie Brooker viewed this as preferable to making viewers wait longer for the next series.[2] The three episodes—""Striking Vipers"", ""Smithereens"" and ""Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too""—were released on Netflix simultaneously on 5 June 2019.[3] As Black Mirror is an anthology series, each instalment can be watched in any order.[4]

""Smithereens"" was written by Brooker, who wanted the series to contain an episode without any futuristic technology, to remind viewers that Black Mirror is not solely a science fiction show. Previous such instalments include the first episode, ""The National Anthem"", and season three's ""Shut Up and Dance"".[5] The two initial sparks for ""Smithereens"" were a question about how a person deals with the loss of a loved one whose life has been recorded in social media and an experience in a rideshare car booked through Uber. In the latter, the driver unexpectedly got out of the car and looked for something in the boot, while Brooker realised he was unaware of where they were. The driver was just getting some water.[6]

The former idea developed into a story where the protagonist was trying to get into the social media account of somebody who died by suicide, but Brooker thought it would be ""extremely superficial and cheap, and also weirdly slightly intrusive"" to give a ""glib reason"" for a character's suicide. In the final episode, the secondary character Hayley has this storyline, but the contents of her daughter's Persona account are not shown. Brooker said, ""Really, she's probably just going to open another box of questions by going in there"".[7]

Executive producer Annabel Jones described Chris as ""overwhelmed"" and said that he ""feels like an onlooker"" over society. Discussing the psychological effects of technology, Brooker said that he used to ""reach for a cigarette first thing in the morning"" as a chain smoker, and now does the same thing with his smartphone for a ""similar reward-feedback loop"".[8] Jones gave the example of a homescreen showing the number of unread emails as gamification, one of many features that witness how phones are ""subtly and incrementally ... designed to absorb you"".[6]

Billy Bauer was written to embody a Silicon Valley entrepreneur: Brooker said that Billy thinks himself a ""switched on, liberal, hippy kind of guy"".[8][9] He was not written to be a ""cartoon villain"" or resemble any particular social media CEOs, though Brooker did take inspiration from a ten-day retreat taken by then-Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Jones commented that Billy is ""as lost as"" Chris and feels ""out of control"".[5]

Brooker described the episode's ending, in which strangers are seen looking at their phones, as a message about how the characters' lives were ""reduced to ephemeral confetti that just passes us by"".[5] The ""most important day"" of Chris's life and maybe Jaden's is ""reduced to the level of a pop-up"".[9]

Having previously talked to Brooker about appearing, Scott joined the cast of ""Smithereens"" as he was ""really gripped by [the main] character.""[10] He described himself as less interested in technology than ""the idea of the vulnerability of people that a simple mistake can be made at any given moment and you can blame it on yourself or you can blame it the powers that be"".[8] Per Scott's request, most of the episode was shot in chronological order, so that he could ""slowly reveal"" more of Chris's character. He said he was ""as playful as possible"" when acting, aiming to perform ""in as many different ways as possible"".[10] One difficulty in filming was that Scott did not know how to drive a car. Production mounted a car on top of a mobile platform and instructed Scott to mimic steering to go along with filming.[11]

Topher Grace—who had recently filmed for BlacKkKlansman (2018)—played Billy Bauer. He had been looking to vary the types of characters he played and was a fan of the show, having particularly enjoyed season two's ""Be Right Back"" and other episodes which ""are more emotional than technology-based"".[12] He was surprised while reading the script when he reached Billy's appearance, having built up an expectation that he would be more villainous.[12][13] He said that similar tech company founders had ""created their own legend"" and that he expected Billy to stand out in a crowd and have a distinctive ""relationship with spirituality"". For this reason, Grace wanted Billy to be bald but after discussion he ended up with a bun. Grace told an interviewer that he was unsure of whether Billy was ""as trapped as he says"", but that he does not personally like ""people like this"".[13] Damson Idris played the Smithereen intern Jaden. His first Black Mirror audition was for the series three episode ""Men Against Fire"".[14]

Director James Hawes had previously directed ""Hated in the Nation"" in the third series.[15] Most of the filming took place in England, overlapping with production of Bandersnatch.[2][10] Urban scenes were filmed in various downtown London locations.[10] Some footage was shot in Harrietsham, Maidstone in Kent and in a field near Gravesend around June 2018. The Fairbourne Reservoir in Kent was used as a location for boardroom scenes.[16] Grace flew to the UK to watch Scott's acting and briefly meet him before the filming of his scenes in Spain.[17] To help Grace match the emotional intensity of Scott during the phone call, an actor was hired to read Chris's lines offscreen—usually the person in such a role is not a professional actor.[12]

The episode's music was composed by the Japanese artist Ryuichi Sakamoto, known for his electronic music and soundtracks. It incorporates synthesisers which, according to Pitchfork reviewer Daniel Martin-McCormick, create ""rising tension"", ""a looming state of emergency"" and are ""steadfastly integrated"" with the episode.[18] The soundtrack was released as an album two days after the episode's premiere.[19]

Charles Bramesco of Vulture and Matt Reynolds of Wired found the episode to have a police procedural style, similar to the third series episode ""Hated in the Nation"".[20][21] Atypical for the genre, the gathering of intelligence is speedy, due to the power of the social media companies, rather than forming the majority of the episode's runtime.[20] ""Smithereens"" is set in 2018; David Sims of The Atlantic said it ""could've been pulled from today's headlines"". He drew the connection that as with ""The National Anthem"", it showcases a news story which ""begins to spiral out of control online"".[22][23] Vox reviewer Aja Romano found that it ""blends a hefty mix of bleak nihilism and social satire"" and ""comes across like a thesis statement for the series as a whole"".[22] Louisa Mellor of Den of Geek saw a ""black comedy of errors"" in Chris's plan quickly going wrong in several ways, and Sims commented that the episode showcases ""classic hostage tropes"" including ""the panicked cops, the slick negotiator [and] the snipers looking for a shot through their scopes"".[23][24] Stephanie Dube Dwilson, writing for Heavy, noted an absence of an ""unexpected"" or ""incredibly dark"" twist, as many prior episodes employ.[25]

The episode suggests that social media companies are unaccountable and make people vulnerable and powerless.[26][27][28] Chris Longo suggested in Den of Geek that the technology is ""purposely designed to give us tiny hits of dopamine"".[27] The former Facebook president Sean Parker spoke in a 2017 event about the addictiveness of social media, saying that he, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Instagram's Kevin Systrom ""understood this consciously"" but ""did it anyway"".[8] Mellor said that it is ""gently ironic"" that Chris uses a meditation app on his phone ""to escape the effects of other apps"".[24] The social psychologist Rosanna Guadagno highlighted that ""research has shown that notifications from our phones have a negative impact on our stress levels, anxiety levels, and overall wellbeing"".[29] The song ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"" occurs throughout the episode and plays in the closing credits; Mellor called the song choice ""a gag about phone addiction"".[24]

The episode shows social media companies as more powerful than law enforcement in profiling people.[25] Guadagno saw Smithereen's information gathering on Chris as ""both a violation of privacy"" and a demonstration of ""what you can learn about someone based on surveilling their digital activities"".[29] Victoria Turk of Wired saw it unrealistic that Smithereen choose to get involved with police activity, saying that such companies ""seem to constantly distance themselves"" from this ""as they don't want that responsibility"".[21]

Critics most commonly compared Billy Bauer to Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter at the time.[20][22][23][28] Thomas Gorton of Dazed and Paste's Jim Vorel made comparisons to Zuckerberg, and Vorel also saw an aspect of Apple Inc. founder Steve Jobs in Billy.[8][30] Smithereen was identified as similar to Twitter, and Persona to Facebook.[22][30][31] Ed Cumming of The Independent commented of the name choice: ""A smithereen is a tiny fragment of something, the debris of an explosion: the firm's users and also the information they post"".[32] Chris Longridge, writing for Digital Spy, saw a ""religious parable"" in Billy, who could represent Jesus or a Christian God. Longridge described Billy as ""effectively omniscient"", with a ""Renaissance-art Jesus vibe"". However, he ""turns out to be just a guy"", which could symbolise an ""existential crisis of humankind in a world that no longer has God"".[33]

Reviewers gave differing descriptions of Chris's motives and behaviour. Olly Richards of NME said that Chris ""holds Smithereen responsible"" for his ex-fiancée's death, an easier choice ""than accepting that he was at fault""; however, Longo said that when Chris talks to Billy, the audience learns that he ""doesn't scapegoat Smithereen"".[27][34] Vorel said that Chris may be ""at war with himself"" over his choices, leading to ""a spastic, explosive sort of nervous energy"".[30] Sims saw the episode as ""a tale of two totally adrift people""—Chris and Billy—""unable to continue living in an interconnected world"".[23] Dwilson saw their conversation as exhibiting ""the power of a simple one-on-one exchange in a world dominated by terse social exchanges"".[25] Guadagno hoped that after their call, Billy could ""make his social media platform about maximizing positive human connection by making people the customer, not the commodity"".[29]

Easter egg references to previous episodes are made through frames of a character scrolling through contacts in their phone, many of whom share names with previous Black Mirror characters, and trending topics on Smithereen include SaitoGemu, a video game company from ""Playtest"", and Tucker, the company behind simulated reality in ""San Junipero"".[35]

The episode received mixed reception, with most critics finding the storyline and subject matter lacking in complexity, but Scott's performance accomplished. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the episode holds an approval rating of 65% based on 26 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, ""A slippery moral dilemma and a superb turn from Andrew Scott make 'Smithereens' watchable, even if its familiar story feels more like an early episode of Black Mirror than a fresh futuristic horror story.""[36] Out of five stars, the episode garnered four stars in The Telegraph, three in the BBC and The Independent and two in Vulture.[20][28][31][32] It received a rating of 7.8 out of 10 in the magazine Paste.[30] Complex's Frazier Tharpe thought the episode was the best of series five, but The Guardian's Lucy Mangan found it ""perhaps least successful"".[26][37] Sims said it was the ""only definite flop"" of the series as it ""suffers from many of the flaws"" of the fourth one.[23]

Critics identified self-parody, drama and cliché as aspects of the episode, and mostly reviewed its tone negatively. Mellor said that it ""feels like an imitation"" of the ""uniquely identifiable personality"" of Black Mirror.[24] Romano and Richards criticised the episode as reliant on clichés.[22][34] Cumming summarised it as ""muted rather than subtle"" and Hugh Montgomery reviewed it for the BBC as ""a rather inert and under-characterised drama"".[28][32] Longridge suggested that the episode may be ""winking at the audience"", given that it relates to a well-known parody of the show's message: ""what if phones, but too much"".[33] Similarly, Mellor and Tharpe highlighted potential self-parody in Chris's rant upon discovering Jaden is an intern, though Tharpe found this nevertheless ""emotionally affecting"".[24][37] Tharpe also praised the episode as tense and ""well-paced"" yet ""casually hilarious"".[37]

The storyline and central theme were mostly criticised. As the longest episode of the series, ""Smithereens"" was criticised for length by Cumming and Sims, who both described the plot as ""thin"", as did Turk.[21][23][32] Mellor said that it ""lacks this show's usual depth"", Turk found ""the scope a bit narrow"" and Richards viewed it as having ""little to say that isn't already common opinion"".[21][24][34] Sims wrote that it was ""hampered by ... how long it takes for the action to get going"".[23] The exploration of social media was reviewed by Turk to be ""a bit two-dimensional"" and Longo saw the episode as ""too self-contained to fully realize the potential of the ideas"".[21][27] Montgomery wrote that the characters are ""being held ransom to a plotline which is a vehicle for some rather clunky point-making"" and Romano saw the message as ""both redundant and a little weak"".[22][28] Bramesco critiqued the episode as having a ""strong concept with lots of avenues for deeper exploration"" which was averted in favour of ""the same old conclusion about smartphones exacerbating our worst qualities"", while both Longo and Turk saw concerns about data privacy to be unsatisfactorily explored.[20][21][27]

Some critics were disappointed by a lack of twists in the episode, while Chris's recounting of the car crash and the ending received mixed reception. Mangan and Reynolds both said that the episode did not ""twist and turn"" as much as it should have and Sims ""kept waiting for a twist that never really arrived"".[21][23][26] Reynolds found the storyline predictable from the 15 minute mark onwards, though Dwilson was ""never quite sure where the episode was heading"" and mostly guessed incorrectly.[21][25] Longo saw Chris's ""big reveal"" about the cause of the car crash to be ""devastating"", but Romano said it ""simply doesn't land with much impact"".[22][27] Mellor saw the ending as a ""more subtle and effective point about social media"", but Richards said it ""falls flat"" and Bramesco called it a ""contrived non-ending"".[20][24][34]

Andrew Scott's role as Chris received critical acclaim. Several critics found that his performance was the highlight of an otherwise poor episode, such as Sims, who said that Scott's ""committed lead performance"" made him ""at least interested throughout"", and Reynolds, who said that Scott ""just about held [the episode] all together"".[21][23] Benji Wilson of The Telegraph found that his ""astonishing control and range ... elevated a too-tidy plot"".[31] Montgomery called the character ""a compellingly twitchy, ambiguous presence"", while Mangan said Scott had ""uniquely potent and peculiar energy"" which is ""perfectly channelled"" into Chris.[26] Longo said that the acting is ""unnerving throughout"", but that Scott ""dials it up to a 10"" in the phone call with Billy.[27] Bramesco viewed it differently, saying that Scott ""feels like he's starting at a ten and leaving himself nowhere to go"" and finding Scott unconvincing in the phone call, ""seemingly uncertain whether the moment should be played hysterically or for genuine pathos"".[20] While Cumming found Chris to be ""the only developed character"", Longo said that the episode ""missed key chances to add depth"" to Chris.[27][32]

Other actors and characters received more mixed reception. Montgomery found Grace ""an amusing Jack Dorsey parody"", and Dwilson ""appreciated how his character surprised [her]"" in his relatability.[25][28] Vorel, in contrast, found it ""rather difficult"" to empathise with Billy.[30] Idris received praise for his role from Dwilson and Romano.[22][25] The storyline involving Hayley was criticised as ""undercooked"" by Cumming and ""extraneous frippery"" by Bramesco, but Vorel found the nature of her attempting to log into her daughter's Persona account every day a ""powerful, Sisyphean piece of imagery"".[20][30][32]

Hawes received praise from Romano as he ""keeps the pace taut"", while Longo analysed that he ""deliberately shot Chris' reactions to the use of phones in a cafe to cast a shadow of isolation around him"" and used ""flashback"", ""foreshadowing"" and ""purposeful misdirection"".[22][27] Pitchfork rated the soundtrack 6.8 out of 10, for being effective but lacking ""iconic melodies"". The reviewer, Martin-McCormick, found that the track ""Meditation App"" would fit in ""the lobby of a high-end spa"", but did not recommend the other tracks as standalone music.[18]

""Smithereens"" ranked poorly on critics' lists of the 23 instalments of Black Mirror, from best to worst:



IndieWire authors ranked the 22 Black Mirror instalments excluding Bandersnatch by quality, giving ""Smithereens"" a position of 11th.[46] Instead of by quality, Proma Khosla of Mashable ranked the episodes by tone, concluding that ""Smithereens"" was the 10th-most pessimistic episode of the show.[47]

As the fifth series of Black Mirror consisted of three episodes that do not tell a complete story, it was not initially clear whether it would compete in TV Movie or Limited Series or Drama Series categories of the Emmy Awards. After Netflix petitioned to allow ""Smithereens"" as a TV Movie, despite a new rule that entries must be 75 minutes or longer, it was initially reported that it would be nominated in this category. Later, the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences announced that the episode would instead be competing as a Drama Series, where performers who appear in less than 50% of a series have the choice to compete in leading, supporting, or guest awards.[48][49] Scott was nominated for the Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series category. The winner was Ron Cephas Jones for This Is Us.[50]

"Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too","

""Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too"" is the third and final episode of the fifth series of the anthology series Black Mirror. The episode was written by series creator and showrunner Charlie Brooker and directed by Anne Sewitsky; it was released on Netflix on 5 June 2019, alongside ""Striking Vipers"" and ""Smithereens"".

It follows Ashley O (Miley Cyrus), a pop singer whose creativity is restricted by her controlling aunt, and Rachel (Angourie Rice) and Jack Goggins (Madison Davenport), teenage sisters who have recently lost their mother. The doll Ashley Too, owned by Rachel, is a clone of Ashley O's personality. Brooker based the episode on a sitcom script he had written years prior, about a punk band who are hanged and return to life to find their manager profiting off their deaths. It was also informed by holographic performances featuring deceased artists.

The executive producers thought Cyrus would be perfect for the role, but were surprised when she agreed. Filming took place in late 2018, for five weeks, in Cape Town, South Africa. Ashley O performs ""On a Roll"" and ""Right Where I Belong"" during the episode—these are adaptations of Nine Inch Nails songs. ""On a Roll"" was released by Cyrus, subsequently appearing on several national music charts as well as receiving a Guild of Music Supervisors Award nomination.

Critics found it to be more upbeat than most Black Mirror episodes. Ashley O's storyline was compared to Cyrus's own life, along with those of other figures in the music industry. Some reviewers analysed personality traits of Rachel and Jack as a reaction to their mother's death. Most critics found the episode lacking in structure, writing quality, exploration of themes and characterisation of Rachel, but Cyrus's acting received acclaim.

Rachel Goggins (Angourie Rice) and her older sister Jack (Madison Davenport) live with their father Kevin (Marc Menchaca) after the death of their mother. For her fifteenth birthday, Rachel receives Ashley Too (voiced by Miley Cyrus), an artificial intelligence (AI) robotic doll of her favourite pop star Ashley O (Miley Cyrus). Much to Jack's annoyance, Rachel treats the doll as a friend, but Ashley Too also compliments Jack's bass playing. Rachel dances to Ashley O's song ""On a Roll"" at a school talent contest, but leaves the stage embarrassed after slipping off a stool. Jack angrily hides Ashley Too, causing Rachel to accuse Jack of suppressing her own creativity.

Meanwhile, Ashley O is unsatisfied with her musical direction and longs to play as a rock musician. When she writes broody music and does not take the medication given to subdue her, her controlling aunt and manager Catherine (Susan Pourfar) laces her food with drugs to render her comatose. When the news reports that the coma was caused by a shellfish allergy, Jack returns Ashley Too to Rachel, who shows no interest.

Six months later, Ashley Too is reactivated by a news report on Ashley O's coma and malfunctions upon learning of her real self's predicament. Jack connects the doll to the software Kevin uses for his humane mousetrap inventions and removes a limiter. Ashley Too reveals herself to be a clone of Ashley O's entire consciousness, and convinces Rachel and Jack to look for evidence of Catherine's crimes at her house. Jack inexpertly drives them there, then poses as a mouse pest control service while Rachel takes Ashley Too to where Ashley O lies comatose. The doll pulls the plug, trying to kill Ashley O to put her out of her misery, but it backfires and Ashley O actually wakes up instead. Jack and Rachel subdue two staff members alerted to the drip's removal by using Kevin's mouse stunner and a sedative syringe.

The now-conscious Ashley O directs the group to a venue where Catherine is debuting Ashley Eternal, a holographic replacement for Ashley O. Pursued by the police after Jack runs a red light, the group drive through the back entrance of the venue, surprising Catherine and the crowd as Ashley O emerges onto the stage.

During the credits, Ashley O performs the song ""Head Like a Hole"" under the name ""Ashley Fuckn O"", with Jack on bass. Rachel and Ashley Too watch while Kevin talks to the bartender. Two dissatisfied fans leave the concert as Ashley crowd-surfs.

A fifth series of Black Mirror was commissioned by Netflix in March 2018, three months after the release of series four.[1] Initially part of series five's production, the interactive work Black Mirror: Bandersnatch increased in scope to the point where it was separated from the series and released as a standalone film; it premiered on 28 December 2018. Although previous series of the programme produced under Netflix contained six episodes, series five comprises three episodes, as the series creator Charlie Brooker viewed this as preferable to making viewers wait longer for the next series.[2] The three episodes—""Striking Vipers"", ""Smithereens"" and ""Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too""—were released on Netflix simultaneously on 5 June 2019.[3] As Black Mirror is an anthology series, each instalment can be watched in any order.[4]

The episode was written by Brooker. It was based on a comedy sitcom script from years prior about a 1977 punk band whose members are hanged by a Conservative minister and return to life to see their manager exploiting their deaths for profit. It also took inspiration from real life holographic performances of dead artists such as Prince, Whitney Houston, and Amy Winehouse; Brooker found the holograms ""ghoulish"" and noted that the subjects ""often pass away in extremely tragic circumstances"". He also considered AI as a means for creating a program which could imitate John Lennon's songwriting or serve as a celebrity virtual assistant.[5] Brooker said that the episode is not disparaging pop music, but criticising inauthenticity in music.[6] According to Brooker, an unused idea saw Catherine revealed as non-human, either with her face being removed to display the machinery behind it, or with her disappearing ""in a puff of smoke"". In the final episode, after her Ashley Eternal plan fails, she looks at the camera and breaks the fourth wall.[5]

Brooker and Jones thought Miley Cyrus would be perfect for the part of Ashley O, but did not expect her to be interested, or that they would get a pop star for the role. However, she was a big fan of the programme, and within a couple of days of them reaching out, she accepted the offer.[7][8] She found the script's portrayal of the music industry realistic, in terms of its ""overt exploitation of artists"" and the way in which decisions are driven by performance metrics rather than creativity.[7] Madison Davenport played Jack. She auditioned without knowing that the episode was part of Black Mirror, and was only told about the scene where Jack distracts a bodyguard from investigating Ashley O's drip removal. She was sent the full script a few days prior to filming. Angourie Rice, who plays Rachel, auditioned later in the process and knew that it was for Black Mirror.[9]

The executive producer Annabel Jones said that the episode was about a musician trying to find her identity and ""break out from the commercial machine"". Jones said that Cyrus's personality matched how the episode gets more ""heightened and sarcastic and satirical"" as it progresses.[5] She also said that Cyrus brought vulnerability to the role, despite her punk-like persona.[8] Cyrus related to Ashley O's desire to explore other genres, something she did after becoming an adult. Cyrus said that her parents took an active role in her career and focused on getting a manager who would take care of her, in stark contrast to Ashley O's manager Catherine.[10] Cyrus contributed ideas about her character's clothing and appearance. She also spoke to Brooker about enjoying a recent performance to a mostly older audience who were not recording the experience on their phones. Some dialogue and ideas from this conversation inspired aspects of Catherine's presentation of Ashley Eternal.[5]

While the episode takes place in America, for financial reasons the filming went ahead in Cape Town, South Africa, taking place six days per week for five weeks.[9][11] After Cyrus was spotted at the Victoria & Alfred Waterfront during filming in November 2018, rumours began that she would appear in the fifth series of Black Mirror.[12][13] Cyrus said that she was able to ""get into Ashley"" as she was isolated from friends and family. Problems in her personal life informed her emotions when portraying Ashley O's life breaking down. On the day that she filmed the scene where Ashley O wakes up from the coma, Cyrus had lost her home to a California wildfire. She used the events to inform her acting, though she had to take some breaks during filming the scene.[10]

The Ashley Too doll's movements were partly captured during the shoot, and partly computer-generated imagery. Two crew members controlled her movements—one for her head and arms, and the other for her wheels—and the doll spun around and spoke in real life. Some parts, however, required the actors to film with a green-screen stick, and the doll was added in during editing. The driving scenes were filmed on a sound stage.[9] The final scene was filmed in a Cape Town bar over the course of a few hours, on Cyrus's last day of shooting, with Davenport saying that it ""felt like ... a small punk venue"". Davenport knew how to play the guitar, but learned the bass guitar over the course of a fortnight for her part in ""Head Like a Hole"". Cyrus and Davenport recorded the audio in a music studio.[9]

Songs performed by Ashley in the episode are adaptations of songs from Nine Inch Nails: ""Head Like a Hole"" was retitled ""On a Roll"", and ""Right Where It Belongs"" was changed to ""Right Where I Belong"".[6][14] A rewrite of ""Hurt"" to ""Flirt"" was made but not included in the episode.[6] ""On a Roll"" was released via YouTube on 13 June 2019 and added to various music streaming services on 14 June.[15][16] It subsequently charted in several countries, including peak positions of 18 in New Zealand and 65 in the UK.[17][18] Billboard ranked the song 28th in their list of the 100 Best Songs of 2019.[19]

During the writing process, Brooker contacted Trent Reznor, the lead vocalist and songwriter for Nine Inch Nails, with a synopsis outline and an explanation that he wanted to adapt their music into pop songs.[6][20] Reznor—whose songwriting partner Atticus Ross produced the soundtrack to the series four episode ""Crocodile""—was a fan of the show and approved. Brooker said that the humour arises from the fact that the pop versions are ""insanely positive"" and ""full of empty affirmations"". As an example, ""On a Roll"" changes the original lyrics ""Bow down before the one you serve"" to ""I'm stoked on ambition and verve"".[6] Reznor said that the songs were ""wonderfully absurd"" and ""really funny"" in context. He found it ""strange to hear [his] music come through the blender and back"".[20] Isobel Waller-Bridge, sister of the actor and writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge, received a credit for adapting the episode's music.[21]

Adi Robertson of The Verge wrote that ""Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too"" is an ""uncharacteristically upbeat story about subverting sinister tech toward good ends and combining a critique of celebrity fandom with a thought experiment about brain uploading"".[22] Tim Brinkhof of The New York Observer said that Black Mirror serves ""to expose the lies and hypocrisies of society"", in this case ""conflict between the artistic integrity of the artist and the financial interest of their producers"".[23] Dan Stubbs of NME suggested that the title is a pun on Rita, Sue and Bob Too (1986), a film about two teenage girls who have a sexual relationship with a married man.[24] Some critics noted a change in tone around halfway through the episode, with The Independent's Alexandra Pollard calling the latter half a ""fun, high-concept heist film"" and Stubbs describing it as ""an adult take on the 1980s, kids' adventure caper, complete with gags [and] a goofy chase"".[24][25]

""Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too"" explores a number of themes that other Black Mirror episodes focus on, such as AI, storage of human memories and drugs.[26] Stubbs said that it was ""not so much science fiction as science fact"", because technologies already exist to facilitate hologram performances and production of new music using an artist's voice and image without their consent.[24] Robertson viewed it as ""mostly allegorical"", and employing technological tropes ""to raise questions about human agency"".[22] Writing in Vox, Alissa Wilkinson found that it asks: ""What images are celebrities allowed to project? And what do their fans receive in return?""[26] Troy Patterson commented in The New Yorker that the episode criticises ""people who tell kids to have faith in themselves because it suits their own cynical purposes"", but nonetheless does ""want kids to believe in themselves"".[27]

The episode makes small Easter egg references to past works by Brooker. In Catherine's office, a cover of the magazine SugarApe, from the 2005 sitcom Nathan Barley, can be seen.[28] Ashley O sings ""Anyone Who Knows What Love Is (Will Understand)"" by Irma Thomas, a song which appeared in four previous Black Mirror episodes, first in ""Fifteen Million Merits"". A news programme references Sea of Tranquility, a fictional franchise mentioned in ""The National Anthem"" and ""Nosedive"", along with a number of events from other episodes. Rachel's high school is named after Colin Ritman, a Bandersnatch character, and Ashley O is treated at St. Juniper's hospital, which appears in ""Black Museum"", where it was in turn a reference to ""San Junipero"". Catherine can be seen using the Smithereen app from ""Smithereens""; conversely, in ""Smithereens"", #AshleyOWembley is a trending topic.[29]

Many critics compared Cyrus's real life to the experiences of Ashley O. She is a singer-songwriter who garnered fame as the protagonist of the Disney Channel teen sitcom Hannah Montana (2006–2011). Similarly, Ashley O is a ""peppy, cookie-cutter pop star"", according to Kelly Lawler of USA Today.[30] Brinkhof found the episode a ""sharp critique on the ethics of stardom"" that ""eerily mirrors"" Cyrus's ""escape from her confining role"" on Hannah Montana. He said that ""to what extent she has become the master of her own destiny or has remained caught up in the economic machinery remains uncertain"".[23]

Earlier in 2019, Cyrus had mentioned ""Free Britney"" during a performance, in reference to allegations that Britney Spears was being subjected to abuse through her then-ongoing conservatorship.[31] Adam White of The Telegraph noted the connection between the allegations and the narrative of ""Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too"".[32] The similarities drew renewed media interest in June 2021 after Spears delivered testimony in a court hearing alleging excessive abuse and control through her conservatorship, including being forcibly hospitalized and medicated against her will as punishment for refusing to perform.[33] Robertson compared ""Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too"" to the same subject, as well as legal disputes between the singer Kesha and her former producer Dr. Luke.[22] According to Stubbs, Catherine ""views a vulnerable dependant as a product"" and is in this way comparable to Murry Wilson and Joe Jackson.[24]

Critics commented on how the death of Rachel and Jack's mother affected the children. David Sims of The Atlantic said that both children experience depression, ""with Rachel retreating into herself ... while Jack lashes out against the world"".[34] Robertson thought the start of the episode ""offers a fittingly melancholic portrait of someone using an imaginary relationship to handle loss and anxiety"".[22] Patterson wrote: ""Where Ashley O is a kind of Pinocchio dreaming of becoming a real girl, Rachel and Jack Goggins are two sisters awaiting their discovery as princesses"". He said the lack of a maternal figure ""abets its qualities as a fairy tale"".[27] In order to ""cope with lonely teenage hell"", Robertson said that Rachel does ""idol worship"" of Ashley O. This connection draws on ""the increasingly reciprocal relationship between celebrities and their fans.""[22] The Ashley Too doll was compared variously to the robotic toy Furby, the virtual assistant Amazon Alexa and the fictional virtual assistant Samantha from Her (2013).[21][26] In contrast with an episode of The Simpsons on a similar topic, ""Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy"" (1994), Rachel is not critical of her doll.[35]

Wilkinson compared Rachel to Kayla, the protagonist of the comedy-drama film Eighth Grade (2018). Kayla is a young girl who films little-viewed YouTube videos about positivity. Wilkinson said that the documentary Jawline (2019) demonstrates ""an eventual cost to the producers of that kind of relentless optimism, especially when the teenage content creators can't keep it up because things at home actually aren't all that great"": this is similar to Ashley O's unhappy private life. Wilkinson wrote that ""Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too"" shows ""repercussions for the audience too"", as a person views themselves as a failure for being unhappy. She asks: ""is it the celebrity performance packaging industry itself that's at fault? Or is it the creators? Or the fans?""[26] On the same note, Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club commented that ""'empowerment' has become a brand, with generic messages of confidence and believe-in-yourself churned out for an audience desperate to hear any assurance that there might be some way out of their misery"".[36]

The episode holds a 51% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 41 critics, indicating mixed reviews. Its critics' consensus summarises that it ""struggles to sew its many concepts together"", and the most major strength is Cyrus's ""wholly committed and compelling performance"".[37] It received ratings of three out of five stars in The Telegraph and The Independent, and two stars from the BBC.[25][32][38] It was rated 5.5 out of 10 in Paste and graded C+ in The A.V. Club.[35][36] The critics Brinkhof, Patterson and Sims thought it was the best episode of series five, while Paste's Jim Vorel and The Guardian's Stuart Heritage found it the worst, with Heritage adding that it was one of the worst episodes of Black Mirror overall.[23][27][34][35][39]

Hugh Montgomery, writing in the BBC, criticised the episode as Black Mirror ""at its most crudely parabolic"".[38] The Hollywood Reporter's Tim Goodman characterised it as an unintentional ""Disney movie spoof"" due to its ""ridiculous plot and obvious writing"".[40] Robertson and Daniel D'Addario of Variety believed it was worse than most Black Mirror episodes, with Robertson finding it a ""corny, scattershot installment of a show that's usually revered for its sharp cynicism"", and D'Addario calling it ""the most majestically wrongheaded"" episode of Black Mirror and of ""prestige television"" in the latest year.[22][41] However, Sims found it an ""intermittently fascinating bit of pop-music melodrama"", albeit ""bizarre"", and Heritage approved that it was not ""pointlessly bleak for the sake of it"".[34]

There was critical consensus that the episode contained interesting ideas, but that these were insufficiently explored. Brinkhof pointed to ""Be Right Back"" and ""White Christmas"" as past episodes that examined themes of cloning and AI more deeply, and wrote that fans ""lamented"" the episode ""for its untapped potential"".[23] D'Addario said that the episode ""has about fifteen potentially fruitful topics on its mind"" but fails to find a good continuation from the premise. An example interesting topic is ""women in music presenting a show of empowerment while being financially and creatively under someone else's control"". D'Addario pointed to the ""fundamental unseriousness of tone"" as a reason the episode does not properly explore its themes.[41] White found ""fascinating ideas sketched here and there"", but a reliance on ""vaguely banal statements on the vapidity of pop and the lack of care afforded to some of its most profitable stars"".[32] Dissenting, Sims argued that ""Brooker does a solid job interpolating"" between ""three big ideas"", where ""no single theme gets to dominate or develop fully"".[34]

Patterson wrote that the show was ""sharpest in its revisionist considerations of genre"", and approved that the episode ""tinkers with the tropes of tween tales and talks back to the genre in its own voice and on its own terms"".[27] Sims thought the Ashley Too doll's consciousness was the ""most compelling"" idea, though it ""arrives late in a muddled tale"" as a ""third-act plot twist"", and Robertson saw ""huge untapped potential"" in having Rachel choose between the real Ashley O and the ""perfect, locked-down"" Ashley Too, or exploring the identity conflict between Ashley O and Ashley Too.[22][34] Handlen asks why Ashley O's consciousness would be uploaded into the doll when it does not ""do anything that much more complicated than empty pleasantries and soundbites"".[36] In contrast, Den of Geek's Rob Leane found it ""brilliantly designed"" and funny.[21] Chelsea Steiner of The Mary Sue said that the episode ""offers nothing new or nuanced"" in its ""poking fun at vapid pop music"", a topic well-explored by other works.[42] Heritage listed A Star Is Born (2018), Vox Lux (2018) and Yesterday as recent works that also addressed how ""young creatives are at the mercy of their morally bankrupt handlers"".[39]

Reviewers were largely disappointed by the writing and structure. Pollard summarised that: ""Plot points are picked up and dropped; narrative arcs lead to nowhere; unnecessary characters abound"".[25] A change in tone midway through was widely commented on, with Handlen writing that ""we don't actually get to the plot till about the forty minute mark"". According to Handlen, it starts as a ""low-key family drama"" and becomes a ""kid's adventure film"".[36] Robertson found that after ""a promising start"", the storyline ""becomes simultaneously overstuffed and underveloped"", omitting ""the intimate details that make its early scenes so compelling"".[22] Montgomery analysed the latter half as a ""hokey-teen-sci-fi-adventure"" that is ""increasingly ludicrous and puerile"" and Robertson said that episode was ""at its blandest during some deeply unnecessary action sequences"".[22][38] Vorel criticised ""clear-cut heroes and villains"" with ""paper-thin degrees of depth"", and Sims believed the villains to be ""particularly overwrought"" as the episode does not explore their motivations.[34][35] However, Leane praised that ""an array of toe-tapping tunes ... really assist the episode in making this pop icon feel real"".[21]

The ending received mixed commentary, as did some individual scenes. It was described as ""gratifying"" by Patterson, ""a really triumphant payoff"" by Leane and a ""fantastic surprise"" that subverted ""the trademark nihilism"" by White.[21][27][32] However, Sims accused the episode of being ""more interested in providing a neat ending than in delving into the deep questions it stirs up"", and Brinkhof reported that some fans ""accuse its feel-good ending of being a symptom of the infamously bleak show losing its uncompromisingly sinister edge"".[34] Leane reviewed that the mouse trap concept ""feels like filler"", though its payoff was ""quite funny"".[21] Sims praised one particular scene, wherein Ashley O's comatose musical ideas are turned into pop music, as ""a classic piece of grim Black Mirror humor"".[34]

Cyrus received acclaim for her portrayal of Ashley O and Ashley Too. Lawler said that ""Cyrus is essentially playing herself ... and she does it well"".[30] Goodman opined that she was ""one of the few actresses and singers who could even make this work"".[40] Pollard analysed that Cyrus was most impressive at playing the ""two extremes"" of her character's emotions: ""desperate and broken"" on one end and ""uninhibited and defiant"" on the other.[25] Montgomery found her early ""subdued, spectral performance"" as Ashley O to be the best part of the episode.[38] Leane and Sims both enjoyed her voice acting as Ashley Too, with Leane calling it a ""tour-de-force performance"" and Sims finding her ""especially charming"" in the role.[21][34] However, Robertson preferred her as Ashley O, writing that Ashley Too is a ""generic robot sidekick"".[22] In contrast, Vorel criticised the characterisation of both versions, saying that the idea ""could have come straight from Cyrus' own marketing team, in a meta-attempt to prove that Miley Cryus The Performer is a being of depth and nuance"".[35] Heritage saw writing problems in Ashley O's later dialogue, saying that she ""stops sounding like Miley Cyrus and starts sounding like a 48-year-old man trying to sound like Miley Cyrus"".[39]

Other characters received less praise. Vorel found Rachel to be so ""hopelessly naive"" that the viewer ""can't reasonably be expected to identify with or even empathize with her"".[35] Handlen crticised that Rachel ""is basically forgotten once the story kicks in"", while Vorel said that Jack ""rarely amounts to more than a sounding board for Rachel's insecurities"".[35][36] Steiner viewed it as unrealistic for Rachel, at the age of 15, to be ""so dependent on"" Ashley Too, and criticised an overall lack of ""authentic voice for any of the leads"", suggesting that having a woman writer may have averted this problem.[42] Leane experienced a ""minor disappointed"" in the lack of ""emotional punch"" in scenes showing Rachel and Jack with their father. However, he praised that ""the core characters all get their chance to shine in a musical number"".[21]

""Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too"" ranked as follows on critics' lists of the 23 instalments of Black Mirror, from best to worst:



IndieWire authors ranked the 22 Black Mirror instalments excluding Bandersnatch by quality, giving ""Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too"" a position of 16th.[51] Instead of by quality, Proma Khosla of Mashable ranked the episodes by tone, concluding that ""Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too"" was the fourth-least pessimistic episode of the show.[52]

In 2020, ""On a Roll"" received a nomination for a Guild of Music Supervisors Award in the category Song Written and/or Recorded for Television, with Trent Reznor as the songwriter, Miley Cyrus as the artist and Amelia Hartley as music supervisor.[53]
