The National Anthem,"

""The National Anthem"" is the series premiere of the British science fiction anthology series Black Mirror. Written by series creator and showrunner Charlie Brooker, it was directed by Otto Bathurst and first aired on Channel 4 on 4 December 2011.

In the episode, a member of the British royal family is kidnapped and will only be released if the British prime minister Michael Callow (Rory Kinnear) has sexual intercourse with a pig on live television. Scenes follow government attempts to track the kidnapper, news coverage of the unfolding events and public reaction. ""The National Anthem"" had several inspirations, the idea originally conceived by Brooker years previous, with broadcaster Terry Wogan in place of a prime minister. It had a deliberately serious tone.

Reviewers identified themes including the spread of information across social media, the relationship between politicians and the public, and the role of news media. The episode garnered seven-day ratings of 2.07 million viewers, alongside many viewer complaints to broadcasting regulatory body Ofcom. Mostly positive professional reviews found the episode to be a good opener for the series, plausible in its storyline and well-acted, though some critics dissented. On average, reviewers have ranked the episode middling in comparison to other Black Mirror instalments.

The episode was later compared to Piggate, an anecdote published in the 2015 biography Call Me Dave, which alleged that British prime minister of the time, David Cameron, had placed a ""private part of his anatomy"" into a dead pig's head as an initiation rite at university.[1]

British prime minister Michael Callow (Rory Kinnear) is woken at night to learn that Princess Susannah (Lydia Wilson), a beloved royal, has been kidnapped. As ransom, the kidnapper demands that the prime minister have sexual intercourse with a pig, live on national television. These demands were posted on YouTube and have been viewed by tens of thousands of people, whilst the topic is trending on Twitter. In the morning, news media stop complying with a DSMA-Notice issued by the government which requested that they not broadcast the story. Within hours, tens of millions have seen the video.

Unbeknownst to Callow, Home Secretary Alex Cairns (Lindsay Duncan) orders Special Agent Callett (Alex Macqueen) to arrange for footage to be fabricated. Callett plans for Callow's head to be digitally composited on porn star Rod Senseless (Jay Simpson), a difficult task given the kidnapper's technical specifications for the broadcast. After a person at the studio tweets an image of Senseless, the kidnapper sends a news channel a severed finger and a video of Susannah writhing in pain as punishment. In a sharp change of opinion, a majority of the public now expect Callow to follow the kidnapper's demands, to the distress of Callow's wife Jane (Anna Wilson-Jones).

Meanwhile, an armed team raid a building from where the YouTube video was first uploaded, but it is a decoy. The journalist Malaika (Chetna Pandya) learned of the raid from a government staff member to whom she sent sexually explicit selfies. Having filmed the scene, Malaika is shot in the leg as she tries to flee.

Cairns tells Callow that he will jeopardise his public image and family's safety if he refuses to comply with the kidnapper. He reluctantly agrees. As a deterrent to viewers, a painful tone plays before the broadcast begins; possession of a recording will become illegal at midnight. Gravely, Callow has intercourse with a pig while 1.3 billion people watch.

Cairns is informed that Princess Susannah was released unharmed in London on the Millennium Bridge 30 minutes before the broadcast, a fact she keeps secret from Callow. The finger sent to the news station was actually the kidnapper's—Turner Prize-winning artist Carlton Bloom, who hanged himself during the broadcast. As Callow vomits in a toilet, ignoring Jane's phone calls, Cairns tells him that Susannah is safe. A year later, Susannah is pregnant and Callow's approval rating has improved. However, behind closed doors, he begs Jane to speak to him as she silently walks away.

The executive producers Charlie Brooker and Annabel Jones began work on Black Mirror in 2010, having previously worked together on other television programmes. The series was commissioned for three hour-long episodes by Channel 4, taking its budget from the comedy department. Brooker's production company Zeppotron produced the show for Endemol.[3] ""The National Anthem"" was the first episode of Black Mirror to air, premiering on 4 December 2011 at 9 p.m.[4] The following two episodes, ""Fifteen Million Merits"" and ""The Entire History of You"", premiered a week and a fortnight later, respectively. ""The National Anthem"" was the third script to be pitched to Channel 4, the first of which was ""Fifteen Million Merits"" and the second of which was not produced.[5]

The initial idea for the episode involved a celebrity carrying out the sex act.[6] Series creator Charlie Brooker had previously conceived of a short story where the broadcaster Terry Wogan would have to have ""full sexual intercourse with a sow"" on television in order to secure the release of a kidnapped princess, later mentioning the idea in a 2002 column for The Guardian.[7] Brooker later became interested in parodying the American action series 24.[6] Whilst working on the story, he realised it would not be humorous. Like his previous work Dead Set, a 2008 horror series about zombies, he decided to ""take something preposterous but make the tone very straight"".[2] The title of the episode refers both to ""God Save the Queen"", the UK's national anthem, and Radiohead song ""The National Anthem"".[2]

Brooker also took inspiration from a controversy where Gordon Brown called a member of the public ""a bigot"" after speaking with her, and also a Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers comic where he believed recalling that ""a police chief is required to have sex with a hog"".[1] Another inspiration was the reality show I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!, particularly an episode where a celebrity was tasked with consuming a mixture of disgusting animal parts. Annabel Jones described the episode's topic as ""humiliation and the public's appetite for humiliation"".[2]

Brooker noted that other animals similar to a pig were considered for the sex act.[1] A duck was believed too small and absurd, whilst a horse or donkey would be too difficult for filming; Brooker also objected to a chicken.[2] Even considered was ""a giant wheel of cheese"", but a pig was chosen to ""[straddle] the line between comic and horrifying.""[1] A scene in which Callow spoke to Rod Senseless was removed, as its comedic style was out of place. Another cut scene showed Malaika taken to hospital and left on a gurney as the staff watch Callow have sex with the pig; removing this meant the setting of a hospital for some scenes was unexplained.[2]

Rory Kinnear stars in the episode as Prime Minister Michael Callow. Lindsay Duncan plays the Home Secretary Alex Cairns and Alex Macqueen plays Special Agent Callett, whilst Anna Wilson-Jones had the role of Callow's wife Jane. During the casting process, executive producer Annabel Jones was keen to hire non-comedy actors so that a humorous tone could be avoided. Director Otto Bathurst commented that the production's first choice for every role was hired. Callow's political party is not stated, though Brooker says his blue tie implies that he is a member of the Conservative Party, a right-wing party in Britain. Jones commented that it would have been easy to make the audience hate Callow, but the focus was on the public's appetite for humiliation.[2]

Filming overlapped with the London riots of August 2011.[2] Brooker and his wife Konnie Huq watched the filming of the scene where Callow has sex with the pig. Brooker reported that in the first take, Bathurst did not call ""cut"", and instead let Kinnear carry on getting closer to the pig, putting his hand on the pig's back, until Kinnear refused to go further.[2][8] The scene was completed in only a couple of takes and was never designed to be more graphic than the final cut.[2]

The scene in which Callow attacks Cairns was written to be ""visceral"", with Brooker noting that he was unsure how a prime minister would act in the situation, and Bathurst commenting that though Callow should be ""kicked out of politics"", his actions go without consequence. In regards to the scene in which Callow's wife expresses distress to her husband, Brooker registered surprise that some viewers were angry at her character. The scene was intended for her to ""‍[communicate] how upset she is"".[2]

During UK pre-publicity, the central concept of a pig was deliberately unmentioned; the Channel 4 trailers, which were briefly run on ITV and in cinemas, also avoided mentioning this. This led to some viewers expecting a political thriller.[2] The episode aired in Australia in June 2013, a year and a half after the UK premiere, as part of Studio's ""Festival of WTF!"" A billboard featuring Callow about to have intercourse with the pig was shown in Kings Cross, New South Wales, in May 2013, but soon removed, with a spokesperson for the channel apologising and plans to show the image in print and online suspended.[9]

""The National Anthem"" is a black comedy and political satire, played straight as a drama.[10][11][12][13][14] Reviewers varied in finding the episode overall comedic,[10][13] or only finding humour in limited parts of the episode, such as Rod Senseless's character.[14][15] A theme identified in the episode was the spread of information amongst a country with both news media and social media such as Twitter.[10][12][15][16] Richard Edwards of GamesRadar+ wrote that ""nobody has any control of the spread of information any more"",[16] whilst David Lewis of Cultbox said that the society depicted was ""so constantly bombarded with data that it is no longer able to process information"".[12] Emily Yoshida of Grantland commented that this information is not making us better or smarter or happier"".[17]

Reviewers also identified the relationship between politicians and the public as a key theme,[15] with Lewis describing the episode as an ""exploration of the potency of public opinion"".[12] Michael Ahr of Den of Geek commented that the internet serves as a ""weapon of attack"" in the episode,[15] whilst Jim Goodwin of Bleeding Cool noted that ""anonymously vented opinions can not only fuel but also help form the actions of government"".[13] Ahr believed that the episode is a ""condemnation of empty rhetoric and slippery politicians"",[15] and Edwards found it ""scarily believable"" that ""politicians are no longer making decisions based on their own judgement, but on the way the story is trending on Twitter"".[16] Additionally, Goodwin commented that viewers are made to examine ""their own culpability in the media frenzies that surround such events"" as that of the kidnapping.[13] Similarly, Corey Atad of Esquire found that the episode examines how mainstream news and social media can both ""bring out some of the very worst in collective human instincts"".[18] The result of the incident, according to John Crace of The Guardian, is that Callow ""lost the love of his wife and gained the sympathy of the nation"".[11] In regards to the plot twist that the kidnapper is a famous artist, David Sims of The A.V. Club suggested that the kidnapper views the recording of Callow ""as a new form of artistic expression"".[14]

The episode was compared to the American 1959 television anthology The Twilight Zone, a programme from which Brooker took inspiration.[10][14] Michael Hogan of The Telegraph made further comparisons to British political satire The Thick of It, with its ""corridors-of-power voyeurism"", and the British spy drama Spooks, with its ""clock-ticking tension"".[10]

In September 2015, four years after ""The National Anthem"" was first broadcast, the Daily Mail published allegations that David Cameron—the British prime minister at the time—had placed a ""private part of his anatomy"" into the mouth of a dead pig as an initiation rite at university. The allegations came from an unauthorised biography of Cameron, Call Me Dave by Michael Ashcroft and Isabel Oakeshott. This incident is widely known as ""piggate"".[1] Black Mirror trended on Twitter following the Daily Mail article's publication,[19] and some people used the hashtag #snoutrage, which appears onscreen during the episode, to refer to the incident.[2][20] Brooker responded on Twitter on the day allegations were first made, denying prior knowledge and describing it the day after as ""a complete coincidence, albeit a quite bizarre one"".[1][21] Finding the story perturbing, he remarked that: ""I did genuinely for a moment wonder if reality was a simulation, whether it exists only to trick me.""[1]

Airing on Channel 4 on 4 December 2011 at 9 p.m., the episode garnered 2.07 million viewers, according to seven-day figures from the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board (BARB).[22] It was nominated for Best Single Drama at the 2013 Broadcast Awards.[23] However, out of television broadcasts in 2011, ""The National Anthem"" received the eighth-most complaints to Ofcom, a total of 145 ranging from the use of profanity to the themes of bestiality, kidnapping, suicide, terrorism and torture.[24] An additional complaint came from a woman featured briefly in a vox pop, whose claim of invasion of privacy was not upheld by Ofcom.[25][26]

The episode received mostly positive critical reviews. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, it holds an approval rating of 100% based on 18 reviews, with an average rating of 9.00/10. The website's critics consensus reads: ""This inaugural tale of political machinations and elite perversions works as a scalding satire and a nightmare of burgeoning technology gone awry, making it a perfect sampler for viewers seeking to step through the looking glass.""[27] It received an A rating in The A.V. Club,[14] 4.5 out of five stars in The Telegraph,[10] four out of five stars in Cultbox,[12] and 3.5 out of five stars in GamesRadar+.[16] Ahr called the themes of politics and social media ""prophetic"".[15] Yoshida and reviewers at TheWrap both found it the perfect opener for Black Mirror,[17][28] with Ahr concurring that it was ""an effective opener despite its off-putting premise"".[15] However, James Hibberd commented that the episode is ""divisive"" and reported that fans often recommend beginning with a different episode.[29] The episode's premise, of the prime minister having sex with a pig, was called ""devastatingly, horrifyingly simple"" by Sims.[14] Edwards felt amusement initially, and later ""revulsion and pity"" as the episode progressed.[16]

Most reviewers found the episode plausible.[12][17] Sims commented that ""every twist seems organic"" and ""every decision rational"", leading the audience to overlook ""the insanity of the premise or any minor plothole"".[14] Yoshida believed that the episode has ""an airtight internal logic"",[17] and Lewis wrote that it was ""exactly what you might expect to happen if the situation ever arose"".[12] However, Crace found that the premise lacked credibility, and the episode was less believable as it progressed.[11] Edwards criticised that the episode does not provide new insight into social media.[16]

The acting received a positive critical reception, with Goodwin describing the cast as ""high calibre"".[13] Ranking Kinnear as Michael Callow to be the 10th best performance in the Black Mirror franchise, Brian Tallerico of Vulture reviewed that the episode only works due to Kinnear's ""emotional commitment to the character and concept"".[30] Hogan praised Kinnear's acting ""particularly compelling"" in his emotional journey ""from disbelief to dutiful self-sacrifice"".[10] Crace thought his character arc was ""both touching and funny"".[11] Lewis found him ""dignified, stoic and – crucially – likeable"",[12] with Goodwin describing him as ""flawed yet entirely sympathetic"".[13] Lindsay Duncan's role, as Callow's press secretary, was also received positively. Crace found her ""understated"" acting ""a delight"",[11] whilst Goodwin praised her ""ruthless"" performance.[13] Goodwin further praised Tom Goodman-Hill in his role of ""the morally malleable face of political spin"" and Anna Wilson-Jones as Callow's wife, for bringing ""grounded emotional connection"" to the episode.[13]

""The National Anthem"" received middling rankings on many critics' lists of the 23 instalments of Black Mirror, from best to worst:



Other critics ranked the 13 episodes in Black Mirror's first three series, where ""The National Anthem"" received varied reviews:
"
Fifteen Million Merits,"

""Fifteen Million Merits"" is the second episode of the first series of the British science fiction anthology series Black Mirror. It was written by the series creator and showrunner Charlie Brooker and his wife Konnie Huq[note 1] and directed by Euros Lyn. It first aired on Channel 4 on 11 December 2011.

Set in a world where most of society must cycle on exercise bikes in order to earn currency called ""merits"", the episode tells the story of Bing (Daniel Kaluuya), who meets Abi (Jessica Brown Findlay) and convinces her to participate in a talent show so she can become famous. The episode was inspired by Huq's idea that her technology-obsessed husband Brooker would be happy in a room covered by screens; it additionally drew motivation from the narrative of talent shows leading to fame. ""Fifteen Million Merits"" incorporates elements of dystopian fiction, science fiction and drama, and offers commentary on capitalism.

The episode received a positive critical reception. The relationship of Abi and Bing drew comparison to that of Julia and Winston in Nineteen Eighty-Four, whilst Abi's objectification was compared to that of female media figures. The episode's ambiguous ending led to discussion about the commodification of dissent. The visual style and music of the episode were praised, as was the romance between Abi and Bing. The acting received a mixed reception, as did the world-building, but the depressing humour and bleak tone of the episode garnered positive reviews. ""Fifteen Million Merits"" was nominated for a British Academy Television Craft Award, but did not win; while on critics' lists of Black Mirror episodes by quality, it generally places middling or poorly.

Bing Madsen (Daniel Kaluuya) lives in a room surrounded by screens that wake him up, serve as a video game console and feature regular adverts. He rides on a stationary bike to generate electricity in exchange for ""merits"", which he needs to pay for his daily cost of living. He sits next to Dustin (Paul Popplewell), an obnoxious man who degrades the overweight cleaners as they pass and watches pornography as he cycles.

Overhearing Abi Khan (Jessica Brown Findlay) singing in the toilets, Bing convinces her to enter Hot Shot, a virtual talent show whose winners can live a life of luxury. He offers to buy her entry ticket, having inherited millions of merits from his deceased brother. The ticket costs more merits than he thought, 15 million, almost his entire savings, but he buys it. Bing goes with Abi to the audition and she gives him an origami penguin. Abi is made to drink a carton of ""Cuppliance"" before performing ""Anyone Who Knows What Love Is (Will Understand)"" by Irma Thomas for the judges Wraith, Hope and Charity (Ashley Thomas, Rupert Everett and Julia Davis, respectively). The judges are unimpressed, but Wraith offers a place for Abi on his pornography channel WraithBabes. Despite Bing's protestations from backstage, Abi, succumbing to pressure from the audience and judges, accepts.

Whilst in his room, Bing sees an advert for WraithBabes featuring Abi. He cannot afford the merits to skip it, and a high-pitched noise sounds when he looks away from the screens, so he must watch. Increasingly agitated, he smashes a screen out of frustration and then hides a shard of glass under his bed. Bing then becomes single-mindedly obsessed with cycling and being as frugal as possible. He buys a Hot Shot ticket and hides the shard of glass in his trousers. Onstage, he starts performing a dance number, then pulls out the shard and threatens to slice his own neck. Wraith goads him to do it, but the other judges encourage him to speak. Bing passionately and angrily rants about the heartless, artificial system they live under. Hope declares the speech the most heartfelt in Hot Shot history and offers Bing his own regular show on one of his channels.

Bing is shown recording his show, where he rants while holding the shard to his neck. Despite criticising the system on his show, he now lives in much larger quarters, and the episode ends with him looking out from his room at what appears to be a vast green forest.

The executive producers Charlie Brooker and Annabel Jones began work on Black Mirror in 2010, having previously worked together on other television programmes. The programme was commissioned for three hour-long episodes by Channel 4, taking its budget from the comedy department. Brooker's production company Zeppotron produced the show for Endemol.[3] ""Fifteen Million Merits"" was the first Black Mirror episode to be written, though it aired second, following ""The National Anthem"".[4]

""Fifteen Million Merits"" was written by Brooker and his wife Konnie Huq;[note 1] an inspiration for the episode was Huq's remark that Brooker would ""basically be happy in a room where every wall"" was an iPad screen.[1] Huq had conceived of a future where the walls of every house would be a touch-screen television, whilst Brooker had been inspired by avatars and Miis on the Xbox 360 and Wii. Huq had also had an idea that gyms should be powered by the energy produced by its exercise equipment.[2]

Additionally, Brooker said that the episode is based on a narrative promoted by talent shows where becoming an ""overnight star"" is ""one of the main means of salvation that's held up"" for people who ""do a job they hate for little reward"".[4] At the time, Huq was presenting The Xtra Factor, a reality series companion show. She had previously presented the children's television show Blue Peter and noted that many children wanted to be famous without knowing what they would be famous for. The episode was also influenced by The Year of the Sex Olympics, a 1968 dystopian television play that comments on reality television.[2]

In an article promoting Black Mirror shortly before its release, Brooker mentioned the ""1984"" ad produced by Apple, Inc. for the Apple Macintosh computer. He said that the advert ""implied the Mac might save mankind from a nightmarish Orwellian future"", but that such a world would instead ""probably"" look ""a bit like"" the one in ""Fifteen Million Merits"".[5] He and Huq nicknamed the episode the ""Screenwipe Story"" because of the similarities between Bing's monologues and Brooker's televised rants on Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe.[2]

The ending went through various drafts. One idea featured Bing and Abi living together, both unhappy with their lives; another idea had Bing deliver his stream and anxiously pore over the ratings for it. One ending revealed that the exercise bikes were not connected to anything, contrary to the implication that they are generating electricity; Jones commented that the viewer may think this anyway.[2]

Euros Lyn directed the episode; Brooker had written reviews of Lyn's work on the science fiction programme Doctor Who and Lyn was familiar with his articles in The Guardian and his show Nathan Barley. Daniel Kaluuya was cast as Bing Madsen, based on an audition in which he performed Bing's rant on Hot Shot. Kaluuya would later be cast by Jordan Peele in the 2017 horror film Get Out because of the strength of this scene. Jessica Brown Findlay played Abi, having recently finished working on historical drama Downton Abbey. Rupert Everett played Judge Hope, Julia Davis played Judge Charity and Ashley Thomas, known by the stage name ""Bashy"", played Judge Wraith.[2]

Additionally, characters riding the exercises bikes include Dustin, an unpleasant cyclist played by Paul Popplewell and Swift, a woman with a crush on Bing played by Isabella Laughland. Hannah John-Kamen was cast as the Hot Shot winner Selma, whilst Kerrie Hayes played Glee, a poor singer wanting to appear on Hot Shot.

Filming took place in Buckingham, on a disused university campus.[6] Due to the small budget, every scene was filmed on one set, which was redressed for each location.[2] The sets feature working screens, as using visual effects would have required a larger budget and more time.[2] For example, when Kaluuya swiped his hand in front of a screen attached to his bike machine, a crew member would press a button to trigger the screen's response. Digital avatars called ""doppels"" represented each character on the screens, including in a large Hot Shot audience. An illustrator and a team of animators worked on the doppels, with every cast member being assigned an avatar, and hundreds more avatars appearing in the Hot Shot audience. Many audience reactions were shot so that they could be inserted as appropriate responses to the story and dialogue.[6] The ""cycling chamber"" shown is one of thousands in the building in which the story take place; a low budget meant this building could only be shown sparingly.[2]

Bing's screen displays different programmes. Whilst the gameshow Botherguts was fictional and had to be filmed, Endemol allowed their gameshows Don't Scare the Hare and The Whole 19 Yards to be displayed on the screens. Additionally, adverts for the fictional pornography channel WraithBabes needed to be filmed; two real pornographic actresses were hired, with one of the actresses bringing her boyfriend to participate in the shoot. For the WraithBabes video featuring Abi, the team shot some graphic elements that were ultimately not used. The final version has the actor put his thumb in Abi's mouth, giving a sense of ""weird violation"" rather than titillation.[2]

To inform Kaluuya's portrayal of Bing, Lyn and Kaluuya discussed Bing's backstory in great depth, considering Bing's relationship with his deceased brother. In a key scene, Bing smashes a screen in his cell after seeing Abi in a porn advert. During filming of the scene, Kaluuya accidentally cut his foot, a moment that was included in the final cut. The episode reaches its climax with Bing's appearance on Hot Shot, where he dances before delivering a rant. Kaluuya worked with a choreographer for the dance, whilst the rant was written by Brooker ""in a real rush"" to imitate Bing's feelings as he speaks. It contains lines that do not make complete sense, such as ""You're sitting there slowly knitting things worse"". Bing's Hot Shot performance was filmed in two takes, with three cameras on Kaluuya.[2]

Judge Hope was inspired by the talent competition judge Simon Cowell, as well as BBC Radio 1 DJs from the 1970s. Davis and Everett both had the idea of affecting Australian accents, but only Everett was allowed to do so. To distance Judge Hope from the singer George Michael, Everett removed his glasses during his first scene.[2]

The episode features an original soundtrack by Stephen McKeon. McKeon agreed with Lyn that the score should use live musicians and sound ""natural"" as a contrast to the artificiality of the setting. The music for Bing's character is Western in genre, chosen to match his cell's personalised theme and to evoke the symbolism of a hero in Western film, which Bing unsuccessfully tries to embody by ""saving"" Abi.[2]

The music for pornography channel WraithBabes features voices by Tara Lee, McKeon's daughter, who was 16 years old at the time. The scene in which Bing works hard to achieve enough merits to enter Hot Shot is five minutes long; the music had to build throughout, and McKeon used a sample of an exercise bike in his composition. The song ""Anyone Who Knows What Love Is (Will Understand)"" by Irma Thomas was chosen by Brooker to stand out from the dystopic setting; he wanted a catchy song with a 1960s style. It recurs in later Black Mirror episodes.[2]

The episode first aired on 11 December 2011, a week after ""The National Anthem"", the programme's debut episode. Coincidentally, ""Fifteen Million Merits"" was initially scheduled to air at the same time as the final of the eighth series of ITV's The X Factor. Brooker contacted Channel 4, who moved the programme to a later timeslot. Trailers for the episode noted that it would air after The X Factor final, and one trailer ran on ITV during the final itself. Brooker commented that Hot Shot was not meant to ""directly be"" The X Factor, as talent shows have different roles in the fictional setting of the episode.[2]

From June to September 2017, scenes from ""Fifteen Million Merits"" were featured at a Barbican Centre exhibit entitled ""Into the Unknown: A Journey Through Science Fiction"". The entrance contained a 6-foot (1.8 m) high installation containing extracts from the episode across multiple screens.[7]

The episode falls under the genres of dystopian fiction, science fiction and drama, with elements of romance.[8][9][10] David Sims of The A.V. Club described it as ""far-fetched satire"", whilst Brooker called it ""an incredibly reductive piss-taking version of capitalism"".[8][2] Alexandra Howard of The 405 identified advertising and capitalism as ""villain[s]"" in this episode and Adam David of CNN Philippines found the world to be ""techno-fascist"".[11][12] The janitors, the exercise bikers and the television hosts can be seen as different social classes.[10][13] David thought that the world represented neoliberalism, a political system in which ""freedom is merely another cage you have to pay your way to get imprisoned in"".[11] The episode addresses disadvantages to contemporary technology as well as more emotional themes: Jacob Hall of /Film found that it takes the idea of microtransactions in video games to ""hellish extremes"" and Ryan Lambie of Den of Geek wrote that the episode addresses the ""fragility of relationships"".[14][9] The episode has a penguin motif, arising when Abi gives Bing an origami penguin, and concluding when Bing's ornamental penguin is seen in the ending.[9]

The episode includes several fictional television shows such as the talent show Hot Shot and Botherguts, in which overweight people are degraded for entertainment. Sam Richards of The Telegraph noted that Hot Shot is ""a caustic satire on TV talent shows""; it was widely considered to be based on the singing competition The X Factor, with Judge Hope in the role of Simon Cowell.[8][15][16] Reviewers have also drawn comparisons to the singing competition American Idol.[13][17][18] David Lewis of Cultbox compared Botherguts to Brooker's previous work TVGoHome.[19]

""Fifteen Million Merits"" was compared to various works of dystopian fiction. Lambie made comparisons to the 20th century dystopian novels Nineteen Eighty-Four, Brave New World and We, due to the plot revolving around a ""doomed relationship"". However, Bing and Abi are opposite to Winston and Julia of Nineteen Eighty-Four, who have their love suppressed by torture, as Bing ""unwittingly sells Abi into a life of exploitation"".[9] Emily Yoshida of Grantland found the story to have parallels to 2006 film Idiocracy, set in a commercialised dystopia.[20] Ian Berriman of GamesRadar+ compared the episode to the works of the American author Ray Bradbury and to the French Marxist Guy Debord's concept of the ""spectacle"".[10] The first shot of the episode—in which a man is woken up in a dark room—is similar to that of the previous episode, ""The National Anthem"".[21]

Bing is a tragic hero, according to Sam Wollaston of The Guardian.[16] Richards believed that Bing can be seen as a satire of Brooker himself, as both can be described as a ""bilious TV critic turned TV presenter"".[15] His character speaks very little for most of the episode before his stream of consciousness-style rant at the judges.[8] Berriman suggests that the character's name could derive from the search engine Bing.[10]

Howard described Abi as a woman who is ""reduced to an object of gratification"". She said that Abi's storyline is relevant to contemporary reality stars and Instagram models, arguing that ""stardom, for women, equates to sexual objectification"". She gave the example of the American media personality Kim Kardashian.[12] Tim Surette of TV.com wrote that the episode provides a ""look forward into our celebrity-obsessed culture"".[13]

The technology and setting of the episode were compared to contemporary technology and games. Sims used the metaphor that Bing is ""stuck inside a cellphone"", and that his life is a game of Candy Crush.[8] Brendan Connelly of Bleeding Cool called Bing's cell a ""little tomb made out of Kinect-equipped iPads"".[21] Sims noted that the doppels each person has resemble Mii avatars.[8]

The ending was widely discussed by reviewers. The forest seen from Bing's window at the end of the episode can be interpreted as real or a computer-generated landscape.[8][19][21] Connelly questioned whether Bing has ""sold out"" or ""been deceived"" into thinking his television show is having an effect.[21] Berriman wrote that the ""system can tolerate dissent, as long as it can be packaged and commodified"".[10] Yoshida concurred that ""even our supposedly clear-eyed dissent to [mainstream media] can be packaged and sold"".[20]

""Fifteen Million Merits"" premiered on Channel 4 on 11 December 2011 at 9:30 p.m., where, according to 7-day figures from the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board, the episode was watched by 1.52 million viewers.[22]

In 2012, Joel Collins and Daniel May were nominated for their work on the episode in the category Best Production Design at the British Academy Television Craft Awards, but did not win the award.[23]

The episode garnered positive reviews. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, it holds an approval rating of 100% based on 14 reviews, with an average rating of 9.50/10. The website's critics consensus reads: ""Combining the worst aspects of reality shows, talent competitions, and a hunger for fame, 'Fifteen Million Merits' effectively shows how anything – even our humanity – could be readily exploited.""[24] It received ratings of five out of five stars in GamesRadar,[10] four out of five stars in The Telegraph,[15] three out of five stars in Cultbox[19] and an A rating in The A.V. Club.[8] As ""Fifteen Million Merits"" was the second episode of Black Mirror, many reviewers made qualitative comparisons to the first episode ""The National Anthem"". Sims found that it is a ""grander work in every way"", while Wollaston called it ""much better"", ""more artful"" and ""moving"", but Connelly found it disappointing in comparison to the first episode.[8][16][21] It was Yoshida's favourite episode of the first two series.[20] Surette wrote that the episode was ""one of the most beautiful and haunting hours of science-fiction television you'll [ever] see"".[13]

The episode was seen by Connelly and Richards to overuse tropes, with Connelly calling it a ""fairly prosaic story situated in an all too familiar future world"".[15][21] Berriman found the world-building lacking.[10] In contrast, Surette believed it to portray ""a fully realized future that might not be too far off"".[13] The episode received praise from Sims, who said it was ""a dazzling piece of science fiction that builds its world out slowly but perfectly"".[8] Lewis said that its moral ""is more sledgehammer than subtle"", but Sims found the ending ""devastating and smart"".[19][8] Connelly wrote that ""the show really punched out through the screen"" in the final scene.[21]

Surette and Wollaston praised the work as ""thought-provoking"", whilst Yoshida found concepts in the episode to be ""bleakly funny"".[13][16][20] It was described by Lewis as ""profoundly depressing"", ""highly watchable"" and ""utterly wretched"".[19] Richards found it to have ""style, savvy and lashings of acerbic humour"".[15] Meanwhile, Surette lauded it as ""gripping"" and Wollaston described it as ""original"" and ""thoughtful"".[13][16] Sims praised the pacing as ""slow"" and ""repetitive"" but ""utterly compelling"". He gave as an example Bing's name being withheld during the first 20 minutes of the episode.[8]

Wollaston remarked that ""all the performances are good"",[16] though Sims found that Bing is ""perhaps too inscrutable"".[8] Lewis praised Kaluuya's acting in Bing's performance on Hot Shot.[19] Richards enjoyed the ""deliciously evil"" judges, but Lambie called Judge Hope ""a little too shrill"" and Wollaston believed that Julia Davis—who played Judge Charity—should have had a larger role.[15][9][16]

Reception to Abi's storyline was mostly positive and the relationship between Abi and Bing was well-received. Though Connelly considered it dubious that Abi would ""choose a life of televised sex abuse over a life of menial labour"", Sims found it realistic, as Abi seems ""blindsided"" just as the audience is.[21][8] Howard found that Abi's story ""rings chillingly true"".[12] Lambie found it to be ""among the most moving"" of recent romances he had seen, praising the ""warmth"" of the characters' romance contrasting with the ""coldness"" of the rest of the episode.[9] Lewis thought the scene in which Abi saw the golden ticket Bing had bought ""genuinely touching"" and his holding Abi's hand was ""sweet"".[19] Lambie singled out the scene in which Abi gives Bing an origami penguin for praise of Brown Findlay's acting.[9]

The production of the episode was universally praised. Sims lauded the episode as ""visually seamless"" and Surette enjoyed the ""gorgeous visuals"".[8][13] Wollaston described the world as ""striking to look at and beautiful"".[16] Lambie believed it to be ""some of the finest production design, music and acting [...] in a genre television show all year"".[9] Surette praised the music as ""moving"".[13]

""Fifteen Million Merits"" placed middling to poorly on critics' rankings of the 23 instalments of Black Mirror, from best to worst:



Meanwhile, Brian Tallerico of Vulture rated Kaluuya's performance the fifth best of Black Mirror, calling it ""delicate and subtle"".[33]

Other critics ranked the 13 episodes in Black Mirror's first three series, where ""Fifteen Million Merits"" received an even spreading of rankings:
"
The Entire History of You,"

""The Entire History of You"" is the third and final episode of the first series of the British science fiction anthology television series Black Mirror. It was the only episode not written or co-written by series creator Charlie Brooker, instead credited to sitcom writer Jesse Armstrong. Directed by Brian Welsh, the episode premiered on Channel 4 on 18 December 2011.

The episode is set in a future where a ""grain"" technology records people's audiovisual senses, allowing a person to re-watch their memories. The lawyer Liam (Toby Kebbell) attends a dinner party with his wife Ffion (Jodie Whittaker), becoming suspicious after seeing her zealously interact with a friend of hers, Jonas (Tom Cullen). This leads him to scrutinise his memories and Ffion's claims about the nature of her relationship with Jonas. The episode was designed to be set in 2050, with stone, wood and metal materials featuring heavily in the sets. The concept of an episode about relationships and the importance of letting things go was pitched by Armstrong.

The episode was less comedic than other works by Armstrong, with critics highlighting its relevance to how mobile phones and the internet allow people to record an increasing number of details about their lives. Reception to the episode at the time of its broadcast was positive towards its premise and Kebbell's acting, with mixed reception to its execution. Later critics generally ranked ""The Entire History of You"" among the best instalments of Black Mirror.

Lawyer Liam Foxwell attends a performance appraisal. Agonising over it, he repeatedly watches the ""re-do"" on his ""grain"", an implant which records footage from his eyes and ears. Arriving at a dinner party for his wife Ffion and her friends, he finds Ffion laughing with Jonas. Throughout dinner, Liam scrutinises Ffion's reactions to Jonas, whose engagement recently ended. Another guest, Hallam (Phoebe Fox), talks about how she lacks a grain after being ""gouged""—an attacker cut into the skin behind her right ear to steal her memories. Improper removal of the grain can blind the victim.

Liam invites Jonas to his and Ffion's house, but then exaggeratedly remembers how late it is and Jonas leaves. Ffion invites the babysitter Gina (Mona Goodwin), who was looking after their daughter Jody, to sleep upstairs. Liam asks Ffion about Jonas, and she identifies him as a brief paramour from Marrakesh. She says they dated for a month, but Liam shows a memory of her saying that she dated ""Mr. Marrakesh"" for a week. The discussion becomes heated, Ffion referencing Liam's former obsession over another man Dan, and Liam calling Ffion a bitch. They reconcile and have sex while watching memories of their past sexual encounters. Afterwards, Liam goes downstairs and drinks copiously while watching re-dos of the dinner party.

When Gina awakens, Liam asks for her opinion on the memories. Embarrassed, Ffion gets Gina to leave. Liam interrogates Ffion further. She now says that her relationship with Jonas lasted six months. Liam drives to Jonas's house—ignoring his car's warnings that drunkenness invalidates his insurance. Jonas is unhappy to see him. Acting aggressively, Liam refuses to leave and hits Jonas in a tussle. Hallam, who apparently spent the night with him, calls the police.

Liam wakes in his car, which crashed into a tree, and replays his memories. Assaulting Jonas, he made him delete his recorded memories of Ffion. Liam spots Jonas's memory of Ffion in bed. He asks Ffion about it. She lies at every step until Liam presses further: after Liam left home over an argument about Dan, Ffion had drunken sex with Jonas around the time Jody was conceived. Aggressively, Liam demands she plays the memory, and she does.

Later, in an empty house, Liam re-watches memories of Ffion and Jody. He uses a razor blade and tweezers to remove his grain, and the screen cuts to black as he pulls it out.

The executive producers Charlie Brooker and Annabel Jones began work on Black Mirror in 2010, having previously worked together on other television programmes. The programme was commissioned for three hour-long episodes by Channel 4, taking its budget from the comedy department. Brooker's production company Zeppotron produced the show for Endemol. ""The Entire History of You"" was the third episode to air, on 18 December 2011.[1]

""The Entire History of You"" was written by Jesse Armstrong, making it the only episode to not give a writing credit to creator and showrunner Charlie Brooker. Executive producer Annabel Jones said that they were looking for a satirical writer whose stories ""still have meat"".[2] Armstrong was a sitcom writer, best known for co-creating Peep Show, which uses point-of-view shots, and had met Brooker several times previously. Armstrong had independently been considering the exponential growth of memory capacity in computers, and pitched an idea relating to the importance of ""being able to forget things"" in relationships.[2] The episode's first draft was too long; Brooker conceived of several consequences of the grain such as people going to the cinema to have affairs as their grains would be turned off for copyright law reasons. The story was scaled down to focus on a ""domestic bubble"".[2]

Brian Welsh was hired as director, based on the recommendation of producer Barney Reisz. Welsh had little industry experience; he focused on Toby's performance and the exploration of jealousy. Scenes were filmed with different intonations and improvisation.[2] Toby Kebbell stars as Liam Foxwell, while Jodie Whittaker was cast as his wife Ffion. She was hired immediately following her audition. Casting director Shaheen Baig commented that the pair are similar actors, as both are ""very emotionally open"" but ""subtle and complex"". Between takes, Kebbell would remain focused and the two were given notes privately by Welsh, so they each did not know how the other was going to act.[2]

The memory technology is known as a grain as it is the size of a grain of rice. The characters control it with a small circular remote that the crew called a ""pebble"". Production designer Joel Collins designed the grain app to resemble tree rings. To distance the episode from science fiction, Collins used materials like stone, wood and metal. The episode is set in 2050 and has a ""mid-century"" feel based on 1950. It uses point-of-view shots to show the characters' memories.[2]

The sex scene between Liam and Ffion was originally conceived as the characters having sex while watching an earlier sexual encounter on the bedroom television. Due to logistical difficulties, the characters instead watch the footage replayed in their pupils, which have the visual effect of being ""milked out"". Brooker describes the scene as feeling ""downright haunting"", whereas the first incarnation was ""amusing and a bit sad"".[2]

During post-production, the creators grew concerned that a certain combination of takes led Liam to be deemed unlikable. Subsequently, the final edit was altered to a focus on a side of Liam that was considered funnier.[2]

When Armstrong made a deal to write the episode, he asked to reserve film rights for the idea. In February 2013, it was reported that the American actor Robert Downey Jr. and George Clooney had bid for the rights to option ""The Entire History of You"" with the intention of making a film adaptation. The rights went to Downey Jr.'s production company Team Downey. Armstrong planned to write the script, which would be about a man who uses a grain to repeat memories with his deceased wife, gradually learning a big secret from doing so.[3][4] In a 2018 interview with Yahoo! Movies, Armstrong reported that the project was in ""development hell"", commenting that no progress was being made but that he was still interested in the project. He suggested that Team Downey's option had lapsed.[5][6]

Though Armstrong was known as a comedy writer, the episode contains little humour.[7][8][9] In comparison to the previous episodes, ""The National Anthem"" and ""Fifteen Million Merits"", David Lewis of Cultbox found it darker in tone, David Sims of The A.V. Club found it made for more uncomfortable viewing and Sam Richards of The Telegraph found it to contain less satire.[7][10][11] Al Horner of GQ called it the ""most emotionally harrowing"" episode, Brendan Doyle of Comingsoon.net writing that although the episode is ""exceptionally dark"", it ends with ""a small ray of hope"".[12][13] Sims summarised the episode as a ""spare, intimate affair centered around three characters and an accusation of infidelity"".[10] It takes place in the near future,[9][11] the primary setting being ""stark, modernist interiors of several isolated country homes"" according to Emily Yoshida of Grantland.[14] Ryan Lambie of Den of Geek commented that the characters are all rich, young and attractive.[8] Comparisons were made to other media. Sims linked its themes to the 1869 novel He Knew He Was Right, about a marriage failing from the jealousy of the husband and stubbornness of the wife.[10] Richard Edwards of GamesRadar+ compared its subject matter to the 1974 thriller The Conversation, about a moral dilemma faced by a man involved in surveillance, further commenting that the director's use of still cameras and lengthy takes resemble 1970s thrillers.[9]

Sims analysed that the episode's exposition is gradual.[10] The primary difference between the fictional setting and the modern world is the grain technology depicted.[7] Facilitating the replaying of memories, the grain allows zooming in, speed alteration and lip reading analysis of a user's memories.[10] When a person is using their grain, their eyes look different, Brooker describing them as ""milked out"".[2] Sims commented that a user's ""eyes glow dully"", which creates ""a demonic look"".[10] Yoshida compared the technology to Google Glass, a pair of glasses with a computer display.[14] The episode shows varied uses for the grain, such as screening at airport security or re-watching a baby's audiovisual feed to ensure the babysitter did their job.[10] Sims found that it is ""easy to imagine"" an uptake in such a technology in future.[10]

Critics found that the episode relates to technologies such as mobile phones and the internet which allow detailed recording of aspects of a person's life.[8][10][15] Yoshida believed that it would seem ""unnatural, even revolting"" to a person from a past era that modern day people can ""recall emotional triggers with the clarity we are capable of.""[14] Richards found that the grain technology could be good for reminiscing on old memories, but leads to increased arguments in relationships.[11] Lambie suggested that imperfect memories can be desirable,[8] Lewis writing that ""deception and misremembering that are integral facets of not only romantic relationships but of life itself"".[7] Yoshida commented that there is a ""complete absence of film, television, and music"" as a consequence of the grain.[14] The scene in which Ffion and Liam have sex while watching themselves having sex previously was found to be ""joyless"" and ""devastating"" by Yoshida and Sims, respectively.[10][14] Lambie questioned the data privacy implications of the grain: ""If citizens have no privacy over the memories, what does this mean for criminals?""[8]

Analysis of Ffion and Liam was varied. Lewis believed Ffion's only inappropriate action in the episode is ""misleading her husband to protect him from the kind of emotional doodlebug he explodes on himself"".[7] Adam David of CNN Philippines found that the episode suggests that small lies and unreliable memories are ""part of being human"".[16] Brooker commented that he has seen a ""reductive"" interpretation of the story as one where ""poor Liam ... found out that his wife was a bitch"", which he disagreed with. However, the writers and executive producers sympathised with Liam to a limited extent. Armstrong found that the grain enabled Liam's pre-existing jealousy. Brooker believed that Liam is a ""weak, frightened, flawed person"" and ""a bit of a bully"" towards Ffion, his issues stemming from insecurity. Jones thought Liam was ""obviously obsessive"" but gained ""slight redemption"" in removing his grain.[2]

Lewis found the episode's ending ambiguous, questioning whether Ffion left Liam or whether Liam killed Ffion.[7] Travis Clark of Business Insider believed that Jonas was the father of Ffion's child.[17] However, Brooker said that the ending was intended to indicate that Ffion had left Liam with their child, whose biological father was Liam, not Jonas.[2] Brooker commented that if there is a moral, it is that Liam ""shouldn't have gone looking for something that was only going to upset him"".[2]

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the episode holds an approval rating of 89% based on 18 reviews, with an average rating of 7.00/10. The website's critics consensus reads: ""Examining how technology amplifies human characteristics, the emotional punch of 'The Entire History of You' comes from positing that we don't need futuristic technology to ruin a relationship – we can do it all by ourselves.""[18] It received ratings of an A− in The A.V. Club, four out of five stars in Cultbox and three stars in The Telegraph and GamesRadar+.[7][9][10][11] The episode was praised by Yoshida as ""emotionally immediate and prescient"", and by Lewis as a ""brave, bitter and bleak production that’s as uncomfortably familiar as it is woefully watchable"".[7][14]

The characterisation received mixed reception. Lewis lauded Kebbell and Whittaker's performances, praising Kebbell as ""excellent in his portrayal of a man coming abruptly apart at the psychological seams"".[7] Sims praised that he felt a ""dark shiver of recognition"" at Liam's actions. However, he believed that Liam's paranoia, alcohol intake and violence escalates too fast.[10] Edwards criticised that he found almost every character very unlikable.[9]

Ideas from the episode were praised, but some critics found the execution lacking. Sims and Edwards found the premise of grain technology believable.[10] Stephen Carty of The Guardian reviewed that the episode was ""grounded in reality"", making it relatable despite a ""fantastical premise"".[19] Richards critiqued that the grain ""wasn't so crucial to the trajectory of the story"" as ""jealous people will always find ways to destroy their relationships"".[11] Edwards found that the execution of the episode ""completely fails to explore the technology's dramatic potential"";[9] however, James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly thought the execution was ""sophisticated and flawless"".[20] While Lambie suggested that the episode would have benefited from being longer,[8] Edwards believed it should have had a more nonlinear narrative. He also suggested focusing on a different aspect of the conceit, such as the unreliability of natural memories or the potential for crime investigators to recover memories directly from a person's brain.[9] Aubrey Page of Collider praised that the ending, despite being predictable, was ""handled with such visual aplomb"".[15]

""The Entire History of You"" often ranks very highly on critics' lists of best episodes. The following critics compared the 23 instalments of Black Mirror, from best to worst:



Meanwhile, Brian Tallerico of Vulture rated Kebbell's performance the third best of Black Mirror, praising him for a ""heartbreaking"" performance as ""a man whose world collapses around him and who gets to watch it fall again and again and again"".[27]
