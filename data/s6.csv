Joan Is Awful,"

""Joan Is Awful"" is the first episode of the sixth series of the anthology series Black Mirror. It was written by the series creator Charlie Brooker and directed by Ally Pankiw. Alongside the rest of the sixth series, it premiered on Netflix on 15 June 2023. It follows Joan (Annie Murphy) as her life is adapted in real-time into a Streamberry television series starring Salma Hayek.

Streamberry is a parody of Netflix, utilising the same design; Brooker said the company had no objections to their portrayal. Marketing for the sixth series featured Streamberry and personalised Is Awful thumbnails. Brooker described ""Joan Is Awful"" as the only episode of the series to fit the show's traditional style. It was inspired by the recency of the events depicted in The Dropout (2022); Joan was written with Murphy in mind after Brooker watched Schitt's Creek (2015–2020). Hayek encouraged more profane dialogue than was in the script for her character, and the addition of facts about herself.

Pankiw saw the episode to explore questions about who can make art and tell stories; the women-led stories and a diversity of crew were important to her. Reviewers identified themes including streaming services, personalised content and privacy. It was considered timely as its writing preceded the release of ChatGPT and 2023 Hollywood strikes by the Writers Guild of America and actors' union SAG-AFTRA, which drew attention to the role of artificial intelligence and computer-generated imagery of actors in entertainment industries.

The episode is more comedic than most Black Mirror episodes and has a happy ending. Reviewers praised its tone and the acting of Murphy and Hayek. However, the episode's pacing and plot received ambivalent response. Some critics disliked the execution of its themes. The episode makes numerous Easter egg references to other Black Mirror instalments through Streamberry's platform and use of the song ""Anyone Who Knows What Love Is (Will Understand)"".

Joan Tait (Annie Murphy) wakes up, eats breakfast made by her fiancé Krish (Avi Nash) and drives to work while lip syncing to Saweetie's rap ""Tap In"" (2020). Under instruction from the board of directors, she fires Sandy (Ayo Edebiri), who worked to reduce the company's carbon emissions. In therapy, Joan contrasts Krish's blandness with her ex-boyfriend Mac (Rob Delaney), who is messaging her. She meets Mac for dinner and they kiss.

Joan and Krish discover a Streamberry show titled Joan Is Awful. Depicted by Salma Hayek, the unlikeable, fictionalised version of Joan plays out events from Joan's day. Krish leaves after seeing the fictional Mac (Ben Barnes) and Joan kiss. The programme shows Hayek's Joan discovering Joan Is Awful, with its own version of Joan (Cate Blanchett), before Hayek's Joan is left by Krish (Himesh Patel).

Joan is fired due to the show and told by a lawyer (Lolly Adefope) that Streamberry's actions are legal due to their terms and conditions. The show is made by a quantum computer using CGI-based virtual actors and real-time data gathered from Joan's devices.

To get a reaction from Hayek, Joan—with a penis drawn on her forehead—dresses as a cheerleader and defecates in a church, interrupting a wedding. After this is depicted in Joan Is Awful, Hayek meets with a lawyer who says that Streamberry can use her likeness like this as she has licensed it to them. Hayek and Joan plot to destroy the quantum computer.

Hayek convinces a receptionist to allow her into Streamberry's office and lets Joan in. They pass the CEO Mona Javadi (Leila Farzad), who explains to the journalist Fatima (Danielle Vitalis) that Streamberry plans personalised, computer-generated content for all users. Joan was chosen as she is completely average, whilst the negativity of the Is Awful brand maximises engagement.

Joan and Hayek reach a technician, Beppe (Michael Cera), who reveals that they are in a simulated reality where Joan is based on a Source Joan (Kayla Lorette) with a likeness of Annie Murphy. Javadi arrives and begs Joan not to destroy the quantum computer, which would destroy all realities below theirs. Joan realises Source Joan has already decided to smash the computer and follows suit.

In the source reality, Source Joan and Annie Murphy celebrate as friends, though they are on house arrest. Source Joan starts a coffee shop, a dream of hers that she shared with her therapist. In a post-credits scene, Source Joan's church defecation is shown.

Black Mirror went on hiatus after its fifth series was released in 2019. Its executive producers, Charlie Brooker and Annabel Jones, departed from the production company House of Tomorrow and joined Broke and Bones, leading to negotiations for production rights.[1][2][3] Brooker took a break from Black Mirror and worked on more comedic projects.[4] In May 2022, Netflix announced that a sixth Black Mirror series was in development. Broke and Bones produced the series, while House of Tomorrow's parent company, Banijay, retained ownership.[5]

Streamberry parodies Netflix, imitating its graphic design, user interface and 'tudum' sound logo.[6] Brooker said that Netflix were immediately supportive of this idea.[7] In one draft, Joan's Streamberry account displayed each of the series six episodes.[8] Marketing for the episode included a mockup of Streamberry's website, streamberry.tv, as well as Netflix social media accounts briefly changing their names to Streamberry. The tie-in website youareawful.com allows users to create personalised Is Awful thumbnails.[6] Billboards with fans' Is Awful images were used to promote the sixth series in the UK.[9][10]

Brooker was the screenwriter for ""Joan Is Awful"".[11] He said it was the only episode of the sixth series to feel like a traditional instalment,[8] albeit more ""overtly comic"".[12] An early idea had Joan the subject of newspaper headlines over petty colleague complaints. Another saw news networks using deepfakes of politicians to create fake news. Brooker was later inspired by the miniseries The Dropout (2022), which depicted the creation and downfall of a disgraced tech startup, Theranos. Brooker said it seemed to make drama from ""things that happened ten minutes ago"",[8][13] and depicted events that the writers could not have had insight into, such as a person dancing with her partner.[14] He also reflected on incidents of ordinary people becoming a ""whipping boy"" on social media.[15]

Filming finished before the chatbot ChatGPT was released; Brooker was happy with the episode's timeliness. Brooker commented that the entertainment industry was considering a future of ""automatically generated entertainment that is endlessly targeted directly at individuals"" and what this would mean for writers.[8] He said ChatGPT could be useful to writers, like Adobe Photoshop to artists, but executives' use of it posed worries.[15] In Brooker's view, ChatGPT does not have the capacity to think but is ""an impersonator"".[7]

An April 2023 casting announcement for Black Mirror named Annie Murphy, Salma Hayek, Michael Cera, Himesh Patel, Rob Delaney, and Ben Barnes.[16] The director was Ally Pankiw; she saw diversity of the crew in gender and sexuality as important.[17] Udo Kramer designed sets for all series six episodes.[18] The soundtrack was composed by Ames Bessada, with whom Pankiw had previously worked, and released on 21 July 2023.[17][19]

Filming took place in September 2022,[20] with ""Red Book"" used as a codename.[21] An American-style bungalow in Crowthorne, England, was used for exterior filming. The owner Jennifer Johnston purchased it with film production usage in mind. According to Johnston, the production crew—numbering 70—added rock gardens and repainted it, also adding shrubs and American postboxes to neighbouring houses.[21][22] The Streamberry office used white, black and red colours to evoke the Netflix logo.[18]

Murphy and Pankiw worked on the comedy series Schitt's Creek (2015–2020), which is referenced in the episode's dialogue.[23] Brooker wrote Joan with Murphy in mind, having recently watched the series. He saw her as ""likeable yet relatable, goofy, and flawed"".[24] Murphy was keen to participate before reading the episode's script.[20] She described being confused at playing herself towards the end of the episode, in contrast to Cera, who seemed to thoroughly understand the story.[25]

Hayek said that playing a fictionalised version of herself allowed for self-deprecation and exploration of people's impressions of her.[26] She had experienced her likeness being used online in ""disrespectful ways"".[25] Brooker said that they wrote ""more tame"" lines so as not to ""scare her off"", but Hayek encouraged ""outrageous"" dialogue.[13] Hayek suggested use of facts about her in the script, leading to mention of her dyslexia and Roman Catholicism.[24] Murphy said of the scene where her character defecates in a church: ""I couldn't be more excited about it and I could picture it"".[27] Hayek, however, did question whether she would get in trouble for her role in the episode.[26] During filming, crew adopted pigtails in ""solidarity"" with Joan, according to Pankiw.[17]

Pankiw believed the episode asked ""who gets to make art?"" and ""what happens when we consume other people's stories?"" She saw the perception of women in media by other women as a feminist theme and liked that the episode had prominent female friendships and women seeking autonomy. Murphy found that Joan's cooperation with Hayek made for an ""uplifting female empowerment"" story.[17]

The episode is a comedy: i's Emily Bootle called it one of the ""most explicitly funny"" instalments of the programme.[28] It was considered a cringe comedy and a dark comedy by Time's Judy Berman and Esquire's Emma Stefansky, respectively, and Alex Cranz of The Verge commented that it was ""gentler"" than other episodes.[29][8][30] It was compared to the first episode, ""The National Anthem"", wherein a prime minister is made to have sex with a pig. ""The National Anthem"" also had a near-future setting and, according to The Daily Telegraph's Ed Power, ""juvenile humour"".[31][32] In The Independent, Nick Hilton said both works were ""Orwellian farce"".[33]

Black Mirror was released by Netflix from 2016 onwards; it made an interactive film specific to this new medium with Bandersnatch (2018). Streaming services such as Netflix are the subject of ""Joan Is Awful"", as well as the following episode, ""Loch Henry"".[34][29] Richard Lawson, a Vanity Fair critic, saw it as commenting on Netflix's algorithm-led strategy, while Power believed it was about binge-watching.[35][32] Power said Javadi parodies Bela Bajaria, Netflix's Chief Content Officer, while Joan's life resembles the protagonist of The Truman Show (1998).[32]

Other themes include artificial intelligence (AI) and personalised content. Black Mirror previously explored AI in ""Be Right Back"", which features a robotic replacement for a grieving woman's dead partner.[7] Amit Katwala analysed that personalised content posed threats to publications such as Wired, which he was writing in, as they rely on common cultural experiences. Katwala suggested that large language models might then generate personalised articles about the personalised content.[36] Privacy was also a motif: Lawson found the episode to satirise nosy neighbours, while Bootle saw it as about Big Brother-style invasion of privacy through data collection.[35][28]

The episode makes liberal use of Easter egg references to other instalments. The song ""Anyone Who Knows What Love Is (Will Understand)"" by Irma Thomas is heard when Joan meets Mac at a restaurant, marking its sixth use in the programme.[37][38] The Streamberry platform shows programmes such as Junipero Dreaming—named after ""San Junipero""—and Finding Ritman—about Bandersnatch's Colin Ritman. It contains thumbnails for fictional shows seen in other episodes (Sea of Tranquility and Hot Shots), and the cartoon Rowdy and Peanut, named after characters in Brooker's Cat Burglar (2022).[39] Streamberry is also key to the following episode, ""Loch Henry"", wherein a character produces a documentary—Loch Henry: Truth Will Out—that can be seen on Joan's account.[39][40]

""Joan Is Awful"" was seen as prescient for its portrayal of a television series made with no human input.[41] It was written shortly before the 2023 strikes by the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and actors' union SAG-AFTRA, who negotiated the role of AI in entertainment with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP).[17] An anonymous SAG-AFTRA member told Deadline Hollywood that actors saw it as ""a documentary of the future, with their likenesses sold off and used any way producers and studios want"";[42] WGA members feared job losses from computer-generated scripts.[43] The AMPTP proposed that actors be paid for a day of digital scanning so that their likeness could be used as background characters.[44] In contrast, SAG-AFTRA demanded ""informed consent and fair compensation"" for use of a person's likeness or performance to be altered with AI.[45] The WGA aimed to prohibit AI's usage in scriptwriting.[46] Pankiw expressed support for the WGA strike when introducing the episode at a live screening.[17]

Despite an approval rating of 94% based on 17 reviews from Rotten Tomatoes,[47] critical response varied. While Rolling Stone and Salon described it as the best of the sixth series, The Daily Telegraph and The A.V. Club saw it as the worst.[48][49][32][50] It garnered ratings of four out of five stars in Den of Geek and i,[31][28] three stars in The Independent and Vulture,[33][51] and two stars in The Daily Telegraph.[32]

Reviewers widely acknowledged the episode as timely for its themes.[52][35][49] However, writing in Paste, Leila Jordan did not find it sufficiently ""surprising or introspective"".[52] Lawson stated that ""Loch Henry"", a ""predictable but compelling thriller"", explored the same ideas better.[52] Jordan praised the satire of Netflix.[52] Contrastingly, Cranz questioned the episode's logic, including the appeal of Is Awful series and the nature of the simulated realities.[30] In addition, Mashable's Chris Taylor criticised it as an example of satire enabling ""pretty awful things"" when the target ""learns to play along"", comparing it to Mattel's villainous role in Barbie (2023) or the prominence that the politician Boris Johnson gained from appearing on Have I Got News for You (1990–).[53]

Critics such as The A.V. Club's Kayleigh Dray praised the humorous style, with Rolling Stone's Alan Sepinwall describing the church scene as a highlight.[50][48] In Den of Geek, Alec Bojalad summarised the episode as ""cynical, caustic, and even charming"", and Melanie McFarland—in Salon—wrote that it was ""hilarious, horrifying and left off-center enough from 2023's actuality to be off-putting"".[31][49] Bootle found it to avoid tropes with its ""winking sense of humour"".[28] However, Power said the episode ""isn't nearly as zingingly funny as it thinks it is"".[32]

The acting was widely acclaimed, particularly that of Murphy and Hayek.[32][48][54][31] Cranz said this was because they had different ""comedic energy"", so their characters were ""brilliant foils"".[30] Bootle praised Murphy's ""perfect comic timing"" and ""outrage of a woman coming undone"".[28] In a dissenting review for Vulture, Ben Rosenstock found that Hayek ""ultimately hurts the story"" as her character ""distracts from Joan"" and is an ""odd fit"" for the programme. He criticised some of Hayek's jokes as ""groaners"".[51]

Reviewers were polarised on the episode's pacing and plot. Although Sepinwall approved of the ""efficient use"" of runtime, Bojalad felt it did not justify Joan's extreme behaviour in a church and Rosenstock said it should have been longer to reduce the exposition in the final 10 minutes.[48][31][51] In a rarity for Black Mirror, the ending is positive.[48][31] Rosenstock lauded it as a ""fitting, mercifully happy"" conclusion;[51] Dray found the ""wildly meta"" ending to redeem the ""meandering middle"" parts.[50] However, Cranz saw it as ""a little twee"".[30]

""Joan Is Awful"" placed as follows in critics' ratings of the 28 instalments of Black Mirror:



GamesRadar+ and IndieWire listed the 27 episodes, excluding Bandersnatch, where ""Joan Is Awful"" placed 7th and 18th, respectively.[62][63] The New York Observer described it as the second-worst of the five episodes in series six.[64]

Loch Henry,"

""Loch Henry"" is the second episode of the sixth series of the anthology series Black Mirror. It was written by the series creator Charlie Brooker and directed by Sam Miller. Alongside the rest of the sixth series, it premiered on Netflix on 15 June 2023. The episode follows Davis (Samuel Blenkin) and Pia (Myha'la Herrold) as they make a true crime documentary in Davis's deserted hometown in Scotland.

Brooker reflected on the cinematic style of true crime documentaries and how he and his wife had considered traveling to Scotland after seeing its depiction in a documentary. ""Loch Henry"" was the first episode set in Scotland, as the setting of ""Crocodile"" was changed to Iceland; 18 locations in Scotland were used for filming. The episode criticises the effects of true crime media on victims. Pia's death can be seen as punishment for her flippant attitude towards other people's tragedies. The episode references other Black Mirror events through newspapers and other text; its themes were compared to ""Joan Is Awful"", which is also about streaming television.

The episode placed around the middle of critics' lists of Black Mirror instalments by quality, though most reviews aggregated by Rotten Tomatoes were positive. Reviewers wrote negatively of the episode's moral but positively about the characters and acting. Critics were ambivalent towards the plot twist.

Davis McCardle (Samuel Blenkin) visits his childhood home in Loch Henry, Scotland, with his American girlfriend Pia Koreshi (Myha'la Herrold). They met on a film course and are pursuing Davis's documentary idea about an amateur conservationist in Rùm who prevents illegal egg collecting. Davis's mother Janet (Monica Dolan) cooks for them, but makes some discomforting comments about Pia.

Davis introduces Pia to his friend Stuart King (Daniel Portman), who runs the only remaining pub in Loch Henry—the Lochside Inn. Stuart's father Richard (John Hannah) is an alcoholic. The former tourist haven is deserted because, in the 1990s, the resident Iain Adair (Tom Crowhurst) made national headlines as a serial killer. Davis's policeman father Kenneth (Gregor Firth) was called to Adair's home after Adair made drunken comments about missing tourists. Adair shot his family, Kenneth and himself. With a shoulder wound, Kenneth acquired MRSA in hospital and died when Davis was eight.

Pia proposes a true crime documentary about Adair. Davis is worried about its local impact, but Stuart believes the film will bring in tourism, and Janet is happy to voice her anger about Adair's responsibility for Kenneth's death. They pitch it to the producer Kate Cezar (Ellie White), who wants new information uncovered. Davis, Pia and Stuart break into Adair's abandoned home and find instruments of torture in the basement. They take footage with an old camera, taping over Janet's Bergerac cassettes. Returning home, they get in a car accident. Davis has to stay overnight in hospital, where Richard—recovering from a fall down the stairs—voices opposition to the documentary.

Pia discovers that Janet's cassettes contain recordings of Janet and Kenneth torturing Adair's victims. Pia flees the house, unable to get phone service. Janet realises what Pia has discovered and pursues her. Pia hits her head while crossing a stream in darkness and dies. Janet returns to the house, leaves a note next to evidence of her crimes, and hangs herself.

Davis assists in a Streamberry documentary about his parents' criminal activity. An interview shows that Richard suspected Janet and Kenneth's involvement after unnerving sexual activity with the couple. Kenneth killed the Adair family and wounded himself to frame Iain.

Stuart is delighted as tourists fill the Lochside Inn and the series wins a BAFTA award that Cezar dedicates to Davis. After the awards ceremony, Davis returns unhappily to his hotel room and re-reads his mother's suicide note: ""For your film. Mum.""

Black Mirror went on hiatus after its fifth series was released in 2019. Its executive producers, Charlie Brooker and Annabel Jones, departed from the production company House of Tomorrow and joined Broke and Bones, leading to negotiations for production rights.[1][2][3] Brooker took a break from Black Mirror and worked on more comedic projects.[4] In May 2022, Netflix announced that a sixth Black Mirror series was in development. Broke and Bones produced the series, while House of Tomorrow's parent company, Banijay, retained ownership.[5]

""Loch Henry"" is the second episode of the sixth series, which was released on 15 June 2023.[6] As Black Mirror is an anthology, each instalment can be watched in any order.[7] It was written by the series creator Charlie Brooker.[8] He said the episode was about turning ""horrible things"" into ""a sumptuous form of entertainment"".[9] Historical technology is key to the episode, such as the VHS recordings of Bergerac (1981–1991).[10] Brooker observed that the ""texture of old media"" had become fetishised.[11]: 7:45–8:00 

Brooker was inspired by true crime documentaries, noticing how the genre's increasingly cinematic and art house style gave an air of being ""somber, serious"" and ""important"". He believed this masked its perverse, ""rubbernecking"" nature.[11]: 3:30–4:00  He and his wife Konnie Huq had thought about holidaying in Scotland after seeing landscape footage of it in a true crime documentary.[12] He thought the genre used such scenery to fill space due to a lack of crime-related footage.[11]: 6:10–6:45 

An April 2023 announcement named Samuel Blenkin, Myha'la Herrold, Daniel Portman, John Hannah, and Monica Dolan as cast members in the sixth series.[13] Kirsty Wark presents Blenkins's character with a BAFTA;[14] Weruche Opia also plays herself at a BAFTA event.[15] The episode was directed by Sam Miller.[8] Herrold and Blenkin said that the episode shows the victims' perspective and puts viewers in Davis's position.[16] Blenkin opined that Davis would struggle to deal with his trauma due to its public nature, and that it could lead him to ""become really cynical"".[17] Hannah discovered that the episode had more than the ""straightforward horror found footage tale"" he initially thought it was, as this narrative is deconstructed.[11]: 2:00–2:30  Portman said he had ""never laughed out loud so much"" when reading a script.[11]: 2:30–2:40 

Dolan had previously played true crime roles such as Rose West and Anne Darwin.[18] She also played an unrelated character—a police officer—in the Black Mirror episode ""Smithereens"".[19] Dolan used a Scottish Highlands accent for Janet that she continued between takes, saying ""if you suddenly go into that accent it's a bit like suddenly doing a very strenuous gym exercise without warming up"". As she still owned a VHS, her knowledge of its features was useful on set.[18]

""Loch Henry"" is the first Black Mirror episode located in Scotland, though the Iceland-based ""Crocodile"" was originally set in Scotland.[12][20] ""Loch Henry"" was always intended to be set in Scotland; Brooker said it had an ""unsentimental strand of humour"" that the episode tried to draw on.[11]: 4:30–5:45  The crew used Loch Lomond as a base and filmed in 18 locations, which were selected by their Scottish location scout, Liam Irving.[12][21] Udo Kramer designed sets for all series six episodes.[22] STV News reported in September 2022 that the main street of Inveraray had been adapted for filming with 1990s-style cars, bunting and signs.[23] A scene where Pia falls into a river took place near the Falls of Falloch.[12] Herrold said the ""creepy"" and ""eerie atmosphere"" made Pia's escape from Janet a highlight of the filming process, although she had to contend with midges in the water.[21]

The visual effects company NVIZ worked on the montage where Davis and Pia cut a trailer for their documentary, which included adding VHS effects on footage, recreating scanning software and replicating old tabloid newspapers.[24] The episode's soundtrack was composed by Adam Janota Bzowski and released on 21 July 2023.[25]

Neil Armstrong of BBC Culture suggested the episode was the most disturbing of the sixth series;[26] critics identified it as a slow-paced mystery fiction with elements of folk horror.[27][28] The episode critiques true crime;[29][28] according to i's Emily Bootle, it reveals the genre as ""pointless"" and ""empty"".[14] Den of Geek's Louisa Mellor wrote that it was rare for Black Mirror to give clear answers to moral questions, but that ""Loch Henry"" does so in its portrayal of true crime.[30]

Davis, Pia and Stuart speak flippantly about Iain Adair's murders. A montage shows the ""tonal dissonance"" in their attitudes.[31] The characters get into a car crash because they are distracted by singing a comedy song about Adair torturing his victims.[14] Davis and Stuart are initially excited, ""not disgusted or saddened"", to tell Pia about the murders, according to Mellor.[30] Pia's death can be seen as retribution for her delight in the unpleasant stories about Adair or for taking advantage of Davis's family tragedy.[30][32] Like characters in the Blair Witch franchise, which is referenced in dialogue, Davis investigates a story and becomes its subject.[32]

A red masquerade mask worn by Janet in the snuff video that Pia watches is a recurring symbol. Janet is seen putting it on again before hanging herself.[33][32] Tourists in the Lochside Inn wear identical masks as costumes.[34] The episode ends with a visual of a mask, on the BAFTA award that Davis wins.[33] According to Vulture's Ben Rosenstock, the note that Janet leaves Davis is a ""little sign of his mother's love"", despite her sadism. Davis has to reinterpret his parents' love in light of their actions.[32] Janet has a collection of Bergerac recordings—according to Marie Claire's Quinci LeGardye, the BBC detective series showcased ""inoffensive crimes"", making it an apt choice for a mother's favourite series.[35]

Stuart's father Richard King owns the Lochside Inn. He objects to the documentary's creation on the grounds that it is opportunistic. This is a red herring that suggests his involvement; he had additional knowledge but did not take part in criminality.[32] Like the Lochside Inn, Shannon Connellan of Mashable noted, establishments associated with serial killers—the Ten Bells, The Last Resort and L&L Tavern—attract tourism.[34]

Comparisons to other series six episodes were made by critics. Streaming services such as Netflix and the fictional Streamberry—both mentioned in ""Loch Henry""[34]—are also the subject of ""Joan Is Awful"", in which the title character's life is adapted in real-time into a television programme.[36][37] The documentary Loch Henry: Truth Will Out can be seen on Joan's Streamberry account.[38][20] ""Loch Henry"", like ""Mazey Day"", criticises mass media and sees inquisitive characters led into danger by their profession.[37][36] Pia is subject to racism, a central theme of ""Demon 79"".[20] The episode was also seen as thematically similar to series one's ""Fifteen Million Merits"", which shows commodification and talent show television impacting human empathy.[30]

Additionally, the episode makes Easter egg references to other Black Mirror events through newspapers, news tickers and BAFTA-nominated documentaries. Referenced events include: Michael Smart of ""Demon 79"" launching his new political party; Cooper of ""Playtest"" being found dead; and auditions for the ""Fifteen Million Merits"" talent show Hot Shots opening in Australia. Brooker highlighted as a favourite that Michael Callow of ""The National Anthem"" is said to run a zoo.[38]

On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the episode holds an approval rating of 87% based on 15 reviews.[39] Out of five stars, it was rated four stars by The Daily Telegraph, Vulture and i,[28][32][14] 3.5 stars by Den of Geek,[30] and three stars by The Independent.[40] The ""delicious sense of impending doom"" and ""pleasing wicked streak"" of the episode were praised by The A.V. Club's Kayleigh Dray and Vanity Fair's Richard Lawson, respectively.[41][42] Lawson summarised it a ""predictable but compelling thriller"" that explored the themes of ""Joan Is Awful"" more successfully.[42] Rosenstock found that it told a ""complete, purposeful story"" with natural exposition;[32] Alan Sepinwall, writing in Rolling Stone, found it well-paced, except for a rushed ending.[27]

The episode's message received criticism. In The Independent, Nick Hilton summarised it as ""vague, underlying commentary on the commercialisation of tragedy"".[40] Rachel Dodes of Esquire found it guilty of the ""torture porn"" that it attempts to criticise; Lawson did not believe its message was original.[43][42] Adi Robertson wrote for The Verge that it makes ""fairly mild observations"" about true crime, but fans of the genre already understand its moral issues. She said it failed to explore ""the potential ugliness of its premise"" or create ""characters who transcend it"".[31] Connellan was incredulous that Loch Henry would not have attracted true crime tourism before Davis's documentary. She suggested the episode could have further depicted the insensitivity of such tourism.[34]

The plot twist and ending was met with mixed feedback. Despite finding the twist predictable, Paste's Leila Jordan lauded the ""great Black Mirror gut punch at the end"".[29] In contrast, Robertson believed the ""deliberately unsatisfying"" conclusion was ""rushed"" and inferior to the plot twist of ""White Bear"".[31] Bootle was surprised by the twist, but experienced a ""frustrating wait"" for it.[14] The ""sad and empty"" conclusion was criticised by Dodes.[43] Rosenstock, in contrast, praised its focus on ""psychological implications"" for Davis rather than ""cultural commentary"", making it a ""fascinating, haunting ending"".[32]

The acting and characterisation was widely praised. Hilton reviewed that the ""sterling"" cast ""bring an increasing sense of unease"" to the episode.[40] Rosenstock praised the ""nice chemistry"" from ""Stuart's brashness"", ""Davis's tentativeness"" and ""Pia's adventurous attitude"", as well as these characters' humour. He found that Pia's greedy side ""doesn't go too far"" and lauded Herrold's performance of Pia's ""horror and disbelief"" at the snuff video and ""barely concealed fear"" in front of Janet.[32] Ed Power, writing in The Daily Telegraph, similarly praised Pia's portrayal as ""an outwardly kind person with an inner core that's all ambition"" and said Blenkin ""shines in the final moments"" of the story.[28] For Bootle, the episode's highlights were Stuart's ""gruff but likeable personality and hilarious quips"".[14] However, Robertson critiqued that Davis lacks ""a strong enough presence"" for his ""familial drama"" to have emotional impact.[31]

Dolan's role as Janet was also praised. Power found that she ""captures the duality of a person with dark depths"".[28] Rosenstock said that Dolan manages to give ""weird vibes from the beginning"" that make sense from a ""lonely, grief-stricken widow"" but suggest something deeper.[32] Though calling Dolan ""excellent"", Bootle criticised her Scottish accent.[14]

""Loch Henry"" received middling rankings on critics' lists of the 28 instalments of Black Mirror:



IndieWire and GamesRadar+ listed the 27 episodes, excluding Bandersnatch, where ""Loch Henry"" placed 13th and 25th, respectively.[51][52] The New York Observer described it as the second-best of the five episodes in series six.[53]
"
Beyond the Sea,"

""Beyond the Sea"" is the third episode of the sixth series of the anthology series Black Mirror. It was written by the series creator Charlie Brooker and directed by John Crowley. Alongside the rest of the sixth series, it premiered on Netflix on 15 June 2023. Set in a retrofuturistic 1969, it follows two astronauts, Cliff (Aaron Paul) and David (Josh Hartnett), who inhabit replicas of their bodies on Earth. After David's family are killed on Earth, he begins to use Cliff's replica and grows closer to Cliff's wife Lana (Kate Mara).

Brooker conceived of the episode as a story about working from home. It was influenced by the Manson Family cult active in the 1960s. The title comes from an English version of ""La Mer"", a song prominent in the episode. Filming took place for three weeks in Whitstable, England, in summer 2022, as well as in London and Spain. Aaron Paul, a fan of Black Mirror, plays both Cliff and David inhabiting Cliff's replica. He had agreed to a cameo in the previous episode ""USS Callister"" under the condition that he could appear in the series again.

Critics identified the episode as character-driven: Cliff is more strict and uptight than David. The masculinity of each character is explored, as is Lana's experience of isolation. The acting was widely praised by reviewers, as was the episode's emotional, contemplative tone, although the plot and pacing garnered a mixed reaction. Overall, many critics considered it the best episode of the sixth series.

In an alternate history 1969, Cliff Stanfield (Aaron Paul) and David Ross (Josh Hartnett) are astronauts two years into a six-year mission. They can transfer their consciousness to artificial replicas of their bodies on Earth when not needed on the ship for routine checks and exercise.

As Cliff and his wife Lana (Kate Mara) recently moved to the countryside with their son Henry, Lana suggests a garden party to meet neighbours, but Cliff rejects the idea. David goes to the movies with his son, daughter and wife Jessica (Auden Thornton) for his son's birthday. He dances to ""La Mer"" with Jessica and fondles her. They are interrupted by an alert: David is needed to supervise Cliff's spacewalk for an unplanned repair.

At night, David hears intruders and approaches with a baseball bat. The four intruders—led by Kappa (Rory Culkin)—comprise a cult that oppose artificial humans. They tie David up; he watches as they kill his family and destroy his replica.

Restricted to the spaceship, David falls silent in grief and shows signs of suicidality. At Lana's suggestion, Cliff lets David use his replica to walk through the forest. David, in Cliff's replica, begins crying and Lana embraces him. On the ship, Cliff is heartened by David's drawing of his house from memory. Cliff allows David to use his replica for an hour per week to draw an oil painting of the house.

David and Lana become more familiar during his visits: he becomes infatuated with her and she enjoys being noticed. When David runs out of linseed oil, he convinces Lana to take a trip into town. They buy a book he recommends; the shopkeeper mistakes David for Cliff and offers condolences to David. Later, David dances with Lana to ""La Mer"", but she rejects his sexual advances. Henry vandalises David's painting, so David hits him. Lana demands he leave and tries to convince Cliff not to allow him back.

Cliff discovers that David has been drawing Lana naked on the spaceship. Cliff punches David, who says that he has nothing while Cliff does not appreciate having everything. Lana confesses the truth to Cliff about David's advances and her feelings.

Cliff responds to an alert and takes a spacewalk, but discovers there is no problem. Meanwhile, David uses Cliff's replica to kill his family. Cliff discovers his replica is covered in blood and finds the bodies. As Cliff returns to the ship, David offers him a seat.

Black Mirror went on hiatus after its fifth series was released in 2019. Its executive producers, Charlie Brooker and Annabel Jones, departed from the production company House of Tomorrow and joined Broke and Bones, leading to negotiations for production rights.[1][2][3] Brooker took a break from Black Mirror and worked on more comedic projects.[4] In May 2022, Netflix announced that a sixth Black Mirror series was in development. Broke and Bones produced the series, while House of Tomorrow's parent company, Banijay, retained ownership.[5]

Brooker was the screenwriter for ""Beyond the Sea"".[6] He wrote the episode as a reaction to COVID-19 lockdowns in the U.K.,[7] viewing it as a story about working from home.[8] On its initial conception, a character's family are killed by a climate change-induced forest fire.[9]: 1:30  However, the setting was changed to 1969—inspired by the historical setting of ""Demon 79"", the first episode in the sixth series to be written.[10] ""Beyond the Sea"" was influenced by science fiction of the era, and the Helter Skelter predictions of the Manson Family cult active in the 1960s. Brooker wrote the characters to follow behavioural norms of this period,[11] saying they act differently due to the lack of mobile phones.[10]

The episode title ""Sea of Tranquility"" was considered, in reference to a fictional television show referred to throughout Black Mirror. The final title ""Beyond the Sea"" references an English version of ""La Mer"". Brooker said the song was ""haunting"" and ""timeless"".[12][9]: 10:00  Brooker mentioned a number of books in his script that are shown onscreen, including The Illustrated Man (1959)—as the 1969 film had scared him—and Valley of the Dolls (1966), as a joke about Lana living with a replica.[9]: 29:30 

First reports in July 2022 revealed the casting of Aaron Paul, Josh Hartnett, Kate Mara, and Auden Thornton,[13] with the casting of Rory Culkin announced in April 2023.[14] The director was John Crowley.[6] Udo Kramer designed sets for all series six episodes.[15] The soundtrack was composed by Volker Bertelmann and released on 21 July 2023.[16][17]

Aaron Paul is among the few actors to have two appearances in Black Mirror, after a voice cameo in the space-themed series four episode ""USS Callister"". He accepted the cameo under the condition that it not preclude him from future appearances. He had also auditioned for a different episode, and was approached for a series five appearance, but could not appear due to other commitments.[18][19][20] Paul was a big Black Mirror fan and stated that the show had encouraged him to limit his use of technology and social media—to the point of not owning a computer.[20] Paul was friends with Mara prior to filming and had met Hartnett before.[21] He had spent a lot of time on farms and had stargazing as a hobby since childhood.[22]

Paul described Cliff as ""heavy-handed"", but imagined that Cliff saw himself as a ""sweet, delicate, nice, loving father"" in comparison to his father.[21] In comparison to Paul, Cliff is ""standoffish"" and ""by the book"".[22] He said Cliff had ""deep-rooted baggage"" and an inability to communicate, but realised this and ""started to go down the right path"" once learning of David's love for Lana. When filming Cliff's discovery of his family's murder, Paul avoided viewing the set to give realism to his reaction, asking only to know the camera locations.[21]

Mara was also a fan of the series and was keen to work on ""Beyond the Sea"" because of its exploration of relationships.[23][24] Mara saw that David, Cliff and Lana all experienced isolation.[7] In Lana's case, she lacks options due to her status as a housewife in the 1960s, but wants her husband to feel present.[25] Hartnett was not present for filming of the scenes where Paul plays David in Cliff's replica.[23] Instead, rehearsals and discussions focused on this element. According to Hartnett, the key was for Paul to embody David's ""internal machinations"", not to impersonate him.[25] Mara said it was always clear which character Paul was playing as David is ""much more present with Lana"" while Cliff is ""gone, in so many ways"".[7] Paul said he studied Hartnett's manner during rehearsals and wanted to capture his ""inherent charm"".[21] Paul and Mara had dance lessons together in preparation for their dance to ""La Mer"".[22]

Hartnett was offered the role a week before filming began.[23] He said that David is an optimist who represents society's hopefulness towards space exploration.[25] Commenting on David's situation, Hartnett said that a person's soul will ""atrophy"" if ""love and connection"" are taken from them.[7] Paul believed David's oil painting plan had no initial ulterior motive.[21] According to Hartnett, David ended up with three choices: to kill himself, Cliff or Cliff's family. The middle choice would lead to his death indirectly. David decides on the last option as a way to ""actually connect"" to Cliff, as both of their families will have been murdered.[25]

After rehearsals in London, three weeks of filming was done in Whitstable, England, in the summer 2022 heatwaves.[21][8] To represent Cliff's rural American house, the production used a house in Whitstable designed by a homesick American. They let the grass grow to give it an ""untouched feeling"", added a barn, and redesigned the interior to fit the 1960s.[26] Filming for David and Lana's shopping trip took place at Rye, East Sussex, England.[27]

The spaceship's interior was built in Twickenham, London—on the same soundstage where the Beatles recorded ""Get Back"" (1969).[10] It was designed with NASA's Skylab in mind, which was launched in 1973. Kramer also took inspiration from the film 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), but avoided the ""flashing buttons and blinking lights"" used in futuristic fiction of the era.[26] According to Hartnett, it was designed to be ""a little too small"", so his height of 6 feet 3 inches (191 cm) meant that he struggled to get through doorways.[24] This brought claustrophobia to the atmosphere.[26]

Three nights of filming took place in Valencia, Spain, where a midcentury home was used for David's residence.[7][15] According to Kramer, the house was built around a swimming pool and incorporated period details. Walls were added to change its layout and furniture was replaced. Kramer said the design had to be ""very serious so that the drama pays off"".[15] Red tiling was replaced by a cream carpet to heighten the ""off place"" aura of the intruders and the effect of the red hue during the violence.[26] Hartnett said the scene where David's family are killed was filmed ""at the end of a very long night"", time-limited, and emotional for him as a parent.[7]

""Beyond the Sea"" is a science fiction and a horror story.[28] It is an example of retrofuturism, showing futuristic technology in a past setting.[29] According to Den of Geek's Louisa Mellor, its setting is used ""as the stage on which to tell a domestic tale"".[30] Ed Power, writing in The Daily Telegraph, found it reminiscent of the Golden Age of Science Fiction.[31] Adi Robertson of The Verge believed that the 1960s period allowed suspension of disbelief by the viewer, as its more limited technology creates capacity for its characters' isolation.[32] Hartnett noted that the killing of David's replica and his family mirrors the Manson Family's murder of Sharon Tate in 1969, the same year the episode is set.[7] Kappa, the leader, represents Charles Manson.[32]

Before ""Beyond the Sea"", past settings were featured in Black Mirror in ""San Junipero"" and Bandersnatch. The former shows pastiches of the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, while the latter is set in 1984.[24] Its exploration of grief through artificial humans is another commonality with ""San Junipero"", as well as ""Be Right Back"". Robertson said ""Be Right Back"" is more metaphorical than ""Beyond the Sea"", using an artificial human as a representation of a character's digital footprint.[32] Marital issues, another theme of the episode, were also the subject of ""The Entire History of You"".[33]

Robertson characterised the episode as a character study. Cliff and David are initially foils, with contrasting uptight and relaxed natures.[32] Unlike Cliff, David demonstrates love for his children and wife, as well as interest in art and music. His wealth, job and family makes him ""everything American society in 1969 told men they should be"", Mellor wrote. Cliff represents an ""older style of masculinity"", according to Mellor: he is shown chopping wood, spearfishing and saying grace,[30] and he is quite indifferent to his wife and child. According to Ben Rosenstock, in a review for Vulture, Lana begins to imagine David as ""the Cliff she originally fell in love with"", exemplified in her comments about David ""wearing her husband like a suit"".[33]

In i, Emily Baker wrote that the episode exemplified how ""men use violence against women as a tool"".[34] An example from Mellor is that David kills Lana as revenge against Cliff. Mellor commented that the men ""treat wives and children as the property of husbands"", in line with 1960s norms, and that ""nothing is so dangerous to women and children as a man with a bruised ego"".[30] Cliff is terse towards his wife and hits his son to control his behaviour.[34] Bryanna Arens, also writing in Den of Geek, believed that both Cliff and David show toxic masculinity, with a ""rigid and limiting"" understanding of manhood. They do not discuss their emotions, and Cliff is surprised when he learns that David cried in grief.[35]

Robertson found the narrative ""strikingly generous"" towards both men: for instance, Cliff's decision to move to an isolated location makes sense given the violence against David's family[32] (although the murder of David's family and his replica is after Cliff's choice of house to live). However, Mellor believed that Cliff makes decisions to limit Lana's socialisation, such as rejecting her garden party idea to keep her ""from the temptations and threats of other people"".[30] Arens analysed that David believes he is owed what he wants: he draws Lana naked without consent and continues caressing her after she tells him to stop.[35]

Lana's books hint at the episode's plot. She is first seen reading Airport (1968), in which the protagonist's intense job leads to marital issues. Valley of the Dolls, which portrays sex and female friendship in New York City, may remind Lana of her previous lifestyle. Its characters suffer issues with relationships and loneliness. In The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress (1966), the book David recommends to Lana, a lunar colony revolts to free itself from Earth's control; its society has two men per woman.[36]

On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the episode holds an approval rating of 87% based on 15 reviews.[37] It received five stars from i;[34] The Independent, The Daily Telegraph and Den of Geek rated it four stars out of five;[38][31][30] Vulture gave it two stars.[33] Several critics saw it as the best episode in the sixth series.[39][28][34]

Critics identified the episode's tone as an asset. The Independent's Nick Hilton and Time's Judy Berman praised its tone as similar to the programme's best instalments, describing it as a ""gloomy, high-concept"" episode and one with a ""poetic, emotional register"", respectively.[38][29] Robertson found that it was ""driven by empathy"", a rarity in the series.[32] Paste's Leila Jordan lauded it as ""enthralling and horrifying in all the best ways"",[28] while Power reviewed it as ""unusually contemplative"" and ""lacking in Brooker's familiar vicious wit"" under the direction of Crowley, a ""master of mood"".[31] Less positively, Vanity Fair's Richard Lawson said that it had ""solemn weight"" but lacked the ""zeitgeist verve"" of other instalments.[39] Daniel D'Addario criticised it in Variety as resembling ""an attempt to provide dramatic bona fides by going as grim as possible"".[40]

The cast garnered acclaim, with reviewers identifying the episode as character-driven.[32][38] For The A.V. Club, Kayleigh Dray wrote: ""The power in this piece comes from its powerhouse performances""—namely, Culkin's ""menacing turn"", Mara's ""gentle warmth"", and the ""ever-growing intensity of Paul and Hartnett"".[41] Lawson praised the ""sharp, layered performances"";[39] D'Addario found the cast, particularly Mara, capable of ""acting out big emotions with delicate restraint"".[40] Neil Armstrong of BBC Culture believed that Paul gave the best performance in the series, despite the difficulty of showing emotion beneath his character's restraint.[42] Baker also praised the ""heartbreakingly raw turn"" of Paul, and of Hartnett's transition from sympathetic to villainous. Baker reviewed Mara as the ""emotional pivot"" of the drama and said she gave ""the performance of her career"".[34] In a negative review, Ehrlich nonetheless praised the cast.[43] Rosenstock, contrastingly, believed the acting was too mute; he criticised Paul's distinction between Cliff and David as too subtle, Lana's lack of liveliness around David, and the lack of explanation for Cliff's stiff manner.[33]

Reception to the plot was more polarised. For instance, whilst Dray believed the technology was ""a poorly disguised plot device"" and Far Out's Calum Russell found the worldbuilding lacking, Hilton thought the episode ""tackles big sci-fi issues ... with superb confidence"".[41][44][38] Hilton compared it favourably to the space-themed science fiction films Moon (2009) and Sunshine (2007).[38] Rosenstock found the plot easy to anticipate,[33] while Lawson wrote that ""Brooker smartly pushes past"" the obvious early twists ""toward a far bleaker place"".[39] Russell critiqued that the premise brought a ""flood of possibilities"" but the writers ""frustratingly decided to go down the least enticing path"". The episode would have been better, Russell suggested, if Lana fell in love with David rather than the reverse.[44] The ending was praised as ""stunning"" and ""admirably twisted"" by Baker and Rosenstock, respectively.[34][33]

Critics also dissented on the episode's length. Jordan saw it as a ""well-told, concise story"".[28] Hilton suggested the climax was rushed and another 30 minutes could have developed the piece.[38] Contrastingly, according to Power, some viewers may find it too slow in comparison to more ""anarchic"" episodes.[31] Rosenstock said the ""pregnant pauses"" do not add value and Alan Sepinwall of Rolling Stone found that every beat is elongated and it ""takes forever to set its plot in motion"".[33][43]

""Beyond the Sea"" placed as follows in critics' ratings of the 28 instalments of Black Mirror:



GamesRadar+ and IndieWire listed the 27 episodes, excluding Bandersnatch, where ""Beyond the Sea"" placed 5th and 14th, respectively.[52][53] The New York Observer described it as the best of the five episodes in series six.[54]

Mazey Day,"

""Mazey Day"" is the fourth episode of the sixth series of the anthology series Black Mirror. It was written by series creator Charlie Brooker and directed by Uta Briesewitz. Alongside the rest of the sixth series, it premiered on Netflix on 15 June 2023. It tells the story of Bo (Zazie Beetz), a paparazza, and Mazey Day (Clara Rugaard), an actress hiding from the media after a car accident.

At 40 minutes, it is the shortest Black Mirror episode. With its title character's transformation into a werewolf, it is the first supernatural horror episode in the show. Brooker wrote it after the sixth series episode ""Demon 79"", another horror story, and aimed to broaden the scope of the programme. Filming took place in June 2022 in Spain.

Set in 2006, the depicted paparazzi pursuit of Mazey was compared to media attention on Britney Spears, Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan. Details such as a full moon foreshadow Mazey's reveal as a werewolf. This twist was widely criticised by reviewers, along with the episode's premise and themes. Many critics considered ""Mazey Day"" the worst episode of the sixth series and one of the worst in the show.

In 2006, a paparazza named Bo (Zazie Beetz) takes photographic evidence at a motel of a male celebrity having an affair with a man. He offers her $500 to delete the photos, but she sells them for $300 each, and the celebrity kills himself. Bo's colleagues Hector (Danny Ramirez), Whitty (Robbie Tann) and Duke (James P. Rees) are unsympathetic. They harass a celebrity with a public sex tape: Whitty provokes her with misogynistic slurs and threatens legal action when she reacts. Bo decides to quit the profession.

The actress Mazey Day (Clara Rugaard) quits filming in the Czech Republic after a hit and run under the influence of wine and magic mushrooms and has not been seen in two weeks. A $30,000 reward is offered for the first image of her. Bo, who was confronted by her roommate Nathan (David Rysdahl) over late rent, tracks Mazey to a film producer's mansion via a takeaway place she mentioned in a magazine article. Mazey, tortured by flashbacks, smashes up the living room overnight and Dr. Babich (Kenneth Collard) arranges for her to stay at a New Age rehab for the weekend. Bo follows the car, but the driver stops at a diner to slash her tyres. She calls Hector to take them on motorbike to the rehab; Whitty has a tracker on the motorbike and arrives with Duke.

The four paparazzi break into the rehab and find Mazey tied up in a room with goats. As Bo undoes her chains, the others take dozens of photos. Mazey warns them to leave. As the full moon emerges, Mazey turns into a werewolf. Whitty and Duke continue taking pictures and are killed, and Bo and Hector try to escape. Hector's motorbike is struck by a car and the driver is attacked by the werewolf as Bo and Hector run through the woods. They make it to the diner and beg a police officer, Clay (Corey Johnson), to call for backup. Bo lunges to take his gun and he begins to restrain and handcuff her.

The werewolf arrives and attacks everybody except Bo, who manages to shoot her with the police officer's handgun. Hector hands Bo his camera as he dies. Bo towers over Mazey, who is heavily bleeding in human form, as Mazey begs Bo to shoot her. Bo hands her the gun, and as Mazey points the gun to her own head, Bo prepares to take a photograph. A gunshot is heard.

Black Mirror went on hiatus after its fifth series was released in 2019. Its executive producers, Charlie Brooker and Annabel Jones, departed from the production company House of Tomorrow and joined Broke and Bones, leading to negotiations for production rights.[1][2][3] Brooker took a break from Black Mirror and worked on more comedic projects.[4] In May 2022, Netflix announced that a sixth Black Mirror series was in development. Broke and Bones produced the series, while House of Tomorrow's parent company, Banijay, retained ownership.[5]

Brooker was the screenwriter for ""Mazey Day"".[6] At 40 minutes, it is the shortest episode of the programme.[7] According to Brooker, the early 2000s placed the setting before ""everyone was a paparazzo"" due to smartphones, where photographic evidence was much harder to forge.[8] Other episodes in the series also had period settings.[9]

The first episode of the sixth series to be written was ""Demon 79"", a horror story set in 1979. Brooker said this episode, labelled as Red Mirror, helped him find a new perspective for the series, closer to ""people are fucked up"" than ""tech is bad"".[10] In writing ""Mazey Day"", Brooker considered ""The National Anthem"", the first episode, which ""was obviously designed to be startling and surprising and weird"". A Red Mirror title sequence for ""Mazey Day"" was made, but Brooker eventually chose the Black Mirror opening titles to conceal the supernatural twist.[11][12] Brooker said that ideally, the titles would change to Red Mirror on repeat viewings.[13]

First reports in July 2022 revealed the casting of Zazie Beetz, Clara Rugaard and Danny Ramirez, who played Bo, Mazey Day and Hector, respectively.[14] The director was Uta Briesewitz.[6] Udo Kramer designed the sets for ""Mazey Day"", as well as the other series six episodes.[15] Beetz said filming took place in June 2022.[16] The local newspaper Diario Sur reported in that month that a Black Mirror episode was being filmed in the Spanish province of Málaga, under the name ""Red Book"". Locations included Marbella, Estepona and the Loasur studios in Coín.[17] Running through the woods at night felt dangerous, Beetz reported, though some scenes set at night were filmed during the day.[18]

Framestore worked on visual effects for the werewolf, including rigging for a digital double of Rugaard transforming into the creature. The werewolf's teeth underwent many iterations and a dedicated system for bones breaking and shifting was developed.[19] The company NVIZ provided compositing of graphics such as computer and television screens and worked on redesigning Málaga backgrounds to resemble Los Angeles.[20] The soundtrack was composed by Ariel Marx and released on 21 July 2023.[21]

According to Beetz, the actors improvised slang and cultural references to the era. The attitude of paparazzi to young female celebrities in 2006 was considered.[22] Rugaard watched documentaries on Britney Spears and Amy Winehouse, while Beetz and Ramirez watched Smash His Camera (2010), to compare Bo's motivations to the paparazzo Ron Galella.[22][23] Beetz said Bo had self-loathing and chose not to empathise with people more privileged than herself.[24] Ramirez commented that each character's shadow self is seen, as they are driven by both good and bad qualities.[24]

Beetz believed that there was a difference between interviewing a celebrity and taking pictures without their consent. Ramirez commented that ""the system itself"" is at fault: while Hector or Bo invade people's privacy, they are forced to make money to pay rent.[24] Beetz said the episode had a ""tongue-in-cheek dark element"".[16] She said the message is that a person who reveals others' secrets will end up ""raw and exposed"" themselves.[25] The episode uses the supernatural in place of technology, but Beetz said it led to ""the same exploration of the human condition"".[26]

Rugaard said that Mazey ""just wants to exist in the world undisturbed"". However, she had unwittingly entered a Faustian bargain where her acting success brought her into the public eye. Though she is commoditised and has fans who worship her, Mazey is lonely.[24] Rugaard said that, as a werewolf, Mazey gets to regain control.[25]

""Mazey Day"", a horror story, is the first Black Mirror episode to feature the supernatural. It has elements of fantasy, another uncommon genre for the programme.[27][28] It is less focused on technology than other instalments.[29] Like the previous episodes ""The National Anthem"" and ""Smithereens"", all featured technology exists today,[30] centrally the camera.[31] To establish the setting, the 2006 birth of Suri Cruise is announced at the start of the episode.[12] An iPod and mention of the Iraq War also indicate the era.[27] Reference is made to Sea of Tranquility, a fictional programme from other episodes.[27]

Celebrity culture is a theme, like in the previous episodes ""Fifteen Million Merits"" and ""Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too"".[32] Reviewers compared Mazey to Paris Hilton or Lindsay Lohan, subjects of immense paparazzi attention in the early 2000s.[33][27] In Den of Geek, Juliette Harrisson said ""ruthless paparazzi ... taking photographs of an injured or dying woman"" resembled the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, which is referenced in ""Loch Henry"".[34] The Independent's Louis Chilton compared the death of Caroline Flack to the celebrity suicide from Bo's photograph and media coverage.[35]

Like ""Loch Henry"", the episode criticises mass media and shows characters pursuing knowledge that leads them into danger.[36][37] Screen Rant's Abigail Miller thought Mazey was hunted like an animal, dehumanising her; Alan Sepinwall wrote in Rolling Stone that paparazzi culture turns everybody into animals.[31][38] The Hollywood Reporter's Abbey White commented that the episode explores what it means to be a ""monster"".[24] Writing in The Verge, Andrew Webster compared Bo's enticement into chasing Mazey to a heist film trope of convincing criminals into ""one last job"".[39]

In Mazey's car accident, she injures a werewolf that bites her as she exits the vehicle.[30] During the crash, a full moon is visible in the sky; police later say a human corpse was found at the scene.[28] The audience initially believes Mazey's distress comes from guilt and addiction.[12][28] The twist is foreshadowed by dialogue from Mazey's doctor and goats left in the rehab for the werewolf to consume.[28] Mazey plays ""Supermassive Black Hole"" by Muse, which is prominently used in The Twilight Saga, a film series about werewolves and vampires.[28] Though the production were aware of the connection before the episode's release, the song was not a deliberate reference.[8]

Describing consent as a focal point, White wrote that Bo and Hector are less aggressive than the white men—Nathan and Duke—in invading subjects' privacy.[24] Harrisson thought the police's dismissiveness of Bo could relate to race, a recurring idea in the sixth series.[34] However, Ben Rosenstock of Vulture saw the officer's reaction as reasonable in context.[27]

On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the episode holds an approval rating of 57% based on 14 reviews.[40] Out of five stars, the episode received two stars in Vulture, i and The Independent,[27][32][41] three stars in Den of Geek,[12] and five stars in The Daily Telegraph.[33] Rosenstock, BBC Culture's Neil Armstrong and Time's Judy Berman saw it as the worst episode of the series,[27][36][42] and Leila Jordan of Paste thought it was one of the worst in the show.[43] Dissenting critics included The A.V. Club's Kayleigh Dray, who believed it was one of the strongest, and Den of Geek's Alec Bojalad, who found it middling.[12][29]

The episode's focus on paparazzi culture was poorly received. Vanity Fair's Richard Lawson said it would have been more relevant 15 years ago, with Armstrong and The Independent's Nick Hilton concurring that the subject matter was heavy-handed and dated.[41][42][44] Chilton wrote that the same themes were more creatively explored in the film Nightcrawler (2014).[35] Esquire's Rachel Dodes described the moral as ""trite"" and i's Emily Baker said it was ""already widely accepted"" that a ""ferocious appetite"" for celebrity unhappiness was wrong.[32][45] Webster opined that the episode's premise is not explored with nuance due to the episode's brevity.[39] Of all the sixth series episodes, Sepinwall found it ""most in need of extra time"".[31] In contrast, Bojalad believed it succeeds as a ""cautionary tale about human nature"" and saw its short runtime as a positive.[12]

Mazey's transformation into a werewolf was also met with backlash.[38] Rosenstock opined that it was both narratively and thematically lacking,[27] while Sepinwall found it unintentionally funny.[31] Harrisson criticised that supernatural elements break the ""promise"" established by the genre and history of the show. She said the viewer would experience ""far less of a nonsensical shock"" if ""Demon 79"" was viewed first.[34] The New York Observer's Laura Babiak did not experience suspense or a feeling of horror during her viewing.[46] In IGN, Samantha Nelson contrasted it with From Dusk till Dawn (1996), saying the latter had a successful tonal shift but ""Mazey Day"" undermines its twist ""by trying to make its final moments emotionally stirring"".[47]

Some critics, however, praised the twist. Bojalad reviewed that there was ""exactly the correct amount"" of foreshadowing, including Mazey's driver's rivet gun and the rehab setup. Mazey's turmoil over becoming a werewolf, according to Bojalad, ""plays better on a repeated viewing"".[12] Dodes praised that the ending was ""so surprising and clever"" as to justify deviation from Black Mirror's norms.[45] Ed Power praised the twist as an ""old-school thrill ride"" in The Daily Telegraph.[33] With ambivalent reactions, Baker said the twist was not bad but lacked inventiveness or novelty, while Webster found the last shot ""fitting"" but ""a little on the nose"".[39]

The characters received mixed reception. Bojalad and Power praised Beetz's acting, the latter describing her as ""wonderfully bare-knuckle"".[12][33] Power reviewed that Mazey is ""sympathetically portrayed by Rugaard as a little lost party girl"".[33] However, paparazzi other than Bo were criticised: Webster found it ""impossible to root for"" them.[39] Bojalad found them ""properly slimy but also quite tiring"".[12] Rosenstock questioned the narrative purpose of Nathan.[27]

""Mazey Day"" was ranked by critics as one of the worst of the 28 instalments of Black Mirror:



GamesRadar+ and IndieWire listed the 27 episodes, excluding Bandersnatch, where ""Mazey Day"" placed 18th and 26th, respectively.[55][56] The New York Observer described it as the worst of the five episodes in series six.[46]

Demon 79,"

""Demon 79"" is the fifth and final episode of the sixth series of the British science fiction anthology series Black Mirror. It was written by series creator Charlie Brooker and Bisha K. Ali, and directed by Toby Haynes. Alongside the rest of the sixth series, it premiered on Netflix on 15 June 2023. It stars Nida (Anjana Vasan), a mild-mannered sales assistant. She releases a demon, Gaap (Paapa Essiedu), who tells her she must commit three murders to prevent the end of the world.

The episode is the first to be released under the label Red Mirror, the result of Brooker experimenting with supernatural horror and past settings. It was the first episode written in the sixth series, with which Brooker aimed to rethink the programme's scope. Set in 1979, it shows anti-immigration politics of the Conservative Party and National Front. It was filmed in June 2022 in Harrow, London.

The demon Gaap, initially designed as a punk, has a look influenced by Bobby Farrell of Boney M., whose music is used in the soundtrack. The episode draws from horror fiction, fashion and settings of the 1970s. It is unclear whether Nida is imagining the episode's events until the happy ending, where she leaves Earth with Gaap as nuclear warfare breaks out. Reviews were positive, with Essiedu and Vasan's acting widely praised, alongside the episode's comedy. However, it was ranked poorly on critics' lists of Black Mirror instalments by quality.

In 1979, Nida Huq (Anjana Vasan) works at the department store Possetts in the English town Tipley. While selling shoes, she fantasises about hurting her xenophobic coworker, Vicky (Katherine Rose Morley). The customer Keith Holligan (Nicholas Burns), who murdered his wife, makes sexual comments towards Nida as she imagines attacking him.

Nida hears the right-wing Conservative politician Michael Smart speaking against immigration. Vandals paint the fascist National Front logo on her door. Vicky complains about the smell of Nida's lunch, so she eats biryani in the basement. There she discovers a wooden talisman, pricking her finger and dripping blood over it.

In her flat, the talisman speaks to Nida and she releases the demon Gaap (Paapa Essiedu), on his first assignment. Gaap takes the form of Bobby Farrell from Boney M. Nida has three days to make three human sacrifices; failure will lead to world destruction on May Day. Nida refuses to accept this, even when Gaap shows her apartment in flames, but Gaap pursues her to a canal. He tells Nida that a passerby, Tim Simons (Joe Evans), molests his eight-year-old daughter. Nida kills Tim with a brick.

Nida vomits with guilt and is late to work, where Gaap urges her to kill again. That night, she drinks scotch at her local pub—The Three Crowns. Nida follows Keith as he urinates in public: he invites her to his house for sex. She bludgeons him with a hammer and also has to kill his brother Chris when he arrives home. Gaap discovers that Keith's death does not count, as he was a murderer, so one sacrifice remains.

Smart, whom Nida's boss supports, visits Possetts and wins Vicky's vote. Gaap shows Nida a premonition: Smart becomes Prime Minister in an upset victory as leader of the ultra-nationalist Britannia Party. Though demons are fans of Smart, Nida insists on targeting him.

The police officer Len Fisher (Shaun Dooley) investigates Tim's murder. He learns of Nida's uncharacteristic drinking, which Nida claims was on the anniversary of her mother's death. He follows Nida by car as she tails Smart after a public speech. She runs into Smart's car, causing him to crash, and attacks him with a hammer, but Fisher apprehends her before the final blow.

At the police station, Nida tells the disbelieving officers about Gaap and the talisman. Sirens blare at midnight as nuclear warfare is seen. Nida joins Gaap—who is outcast after failing his initiation—in an eternal void.

Black Mirror went on hiatus after its fifth series was released in 2019. Its executive producers, Charlie Brooker and Annabel Jones, departed from the production company House of Tomorrow and joined Broke and Bones, leading to negotiations for production rights.[1][2][3] Brooker took a break from Black Mirror and worked on more comedic projects.[4] In May 2022, Netflix announced that a sixth Black Mirror series was in development. Broke and Bones produced the series, while House of Tomorrow's parent company, Banijay, retained ownership.[5]

""Demon 79"" is the last of the five episodes in series six, though it was the first to be written. The series was released on 15 June 2023.[6][7] As Black Mirror is an anthology, each instalment can be watched in any order.[8] The episode was written by Brooker and Bisha K. Ali.[9][10][11] Ali is the only co-writer of the sixth series; she created the series Ms. Marvel (2022).[12] Ali also received a credit as executive producer of the series six episode ""Joan Is Awful"".[13]

Brooker noted that, since Black Mirror's 2011 debut, dystopian sci-fi with technological themes had gone from rare to common, so he aimed to write horror fiction and period dramas.[10] He conceived of ""Demon 79"" as the first episode of a companion retro-themed horror anthology series called Red Mirror.[11] The episode's supernatural elements are designed to evoke 1970s horror movies.[10] According to Brooker, more episodes could be made under the Red Mirror label depending on the success of ""Demon 79"".[10]

The episode was instead included in series six of Black Mirror, which Brooker described as a ""conscious decision to slightly upend what the show is"".[7] Its title sequence reads, Black Mirror Presents: A Red Mirror Film.[14] This allowed Brooker to find a different perspective for the series and dispel the idea that the series is saying ""tech is bad"" rather than ""people are fucked up"".[7] Inspired by ""Demon 79"", other episodes in the series are set in the past: ""Beyond the Sea"" was changed from a near-future story to one in 1969 and ""Mazey Day"" is set in the mid-2000s.[10][15]

First reports in July 2022 revealed the casting of Paapa Essiedu and Anjana Vasan,[16] with additional cast members Katherine Rose Morley and David Shields revealed in May 2023.[9] Nicholas Burns, who plays Keith Holligan, starred in Nathan Barley (2005), which was co-created by Charlie Brooker.[17] Vasan is one of the few actors to appear in multiple Black Mirror episodes; she had a small role in ""Nosedive"", wearing silver paint and credited as ""Space Cop"".[12][18] Her other roles include Amina in We Are Lady Parts (2021–) and Stella in A Streetcar Named Desire, characters that are underestimated, like Nida.[19]

""Demon 79"" was the second episode directed by Toby Haynes, after ""USS Callister"".[20] Brooker said it was made as ""a lost corner of the late 70s that's shot through with a sort of modern sensibility"".[21] The local newspaper Harrow Online reported that it was filmed in Harrow, London, in June 2022, under the code name ""Project Red Book"". Exterior shots of Possetts were sighted in Greenhill, Harrow.[22][23] Udo Kramer designed sets for all series six episodes. Kramer said that much research was done on 1970s department stores; the furniture and fixtures were made specifically for the episode and the colour palette was chosen to match the period.[24] NVIZ Studio worked on the news reports that show Smart's rise to fascist leader, with iterations of Britannia Party messaging over three decades.[25] Additional black-and-white photography was taken by David Hurn.[26] The soundtrack was composed by Christopher Willis and released on 21 July 2023.[27]

Ali and Vasan, both immigrants, spoke about the racial themes of the episode during the production process.[28] Vasan could relate to Nida as an Indian-born woman who moved to Singapore in childhood and Britain in adulthood.[18][19] Nida's fantasies of violence, according to Vasan, may be ""so vivid"" because Nida has to repress her emotions despite constant microaggressions against her.[29] Vasan's first question to the writers was over Nida's comment ""people said my mum was mad"". This is left unexplained, so Vasan speculated that Nida's mother may have been ""loud and eccentric"" and, unlike Nida, not tried to assimilate to England. This contrasts with the interpretation that Nida's mother had mental health issues and Nida imagined Gaap.[30] Vasan thought that Nida herself questions whether she is ""just going insane"".[29]

Gaap was initially written as a punk figure, similar to the skinheads seen outside Nida's door, to embody Nida's fears. Costume fittings were done with Essiedu as a punk.[15][31] As Nida and Gaap developed to have a close relationship, Gaap's appearance was changed to appeal to Nida.[31] Essiedu said the episode could be seen as a love story between the two.[15] Vasan said that they had natural chemistry due to a shared background in theater.[28]

Brooker said that while listening to a playlist he made of late 1970s music he recalled the ""strong visual look"" of Boney M. and based Gaap's appearance on Farrell. Nida is ""intrigued"" or ""excited"" or ""titillated"" by Gaap, according to Essiedu. He said that Farrell was one of multiple ""hyper-femme men"" entering popular culture around this time. Essiedu described Farrell's role in the band as ""his physicality, his dancing, his vibes"", and tried to capture this ""showmanship"".[31] Essiedu's outfit included black nails, shoulder pads and six-inch platform shoes.[12][31]

Essiedu saw the political themes of ""Demon 79"" as having contemporary relevance, as the episode features an active political party and ""the same kind of campaign slogans"" as modern politicians.[12] Vasan drew parallels to modern politicians using the anti-immigration slogan ""stop the boats"".[18] Essiedu saw the ending as ""quite hopeful"", choosing to show Nida and Gaap leaving Earth rather than the reality of spending forever together.[31]

According to the production, the decision to have Gaap teleport wherever Nida looks when she is trying to run away was made on the day of filming, with Essiedu crouching and running to minimise the ""camera trickery"". Haynes discussed with Vasan what it would feel like to Nida when Gaap shows a horrifying vision—like a panic attack or the inability to breathe—and Vasan experimented with her reactions on set.[29]

The episode is a supernatural horror and fantasy story, lacking the science fiction elements of other Black Mirror episodes.[13][32] Tonally, it evokes horror films of the 1970s, such as Hammer Horror or video nasties—low-budget, violent films.[33] Additionally, it incorporates elements of comedy. In The Independent, Nick Hilton classified it as the most comedic episode of the sixth series through the ""mismatched partnership"" of Nida and Gaap, with a similar combination of comedy, violence and apocalypse to The Cabin in the Woods (2011).[34] Ed Power, writing in The Daily Telegraph, said that it was ""cartoonish"" while maintaining serious themes.[33] GQ's Jack King suggested it was a buddy film due to the unlikely partnership of Nida and Gaap.[35]

Reviewers commented that the episode would fit in classic or contemporary anthology series such as Tales from the Darkside (1983–1988) or Guillermo del Toro's Cabinet of Curiosities (2022).[36][37] However, Time's Judy Berman wrote that it shares ""a shift in reality"" that contains social commentary and ""ends in a monster twist"" with other Black Mirror episodes.[36] Jen Chaney of Vulture commented that the ""futuristic terror"" was nuclear war or the racist Tipley characters' fears of white people being outnumbered.[38] With a British cast, dark humour and ""budget aesthetic"", King saw it as a ""return to roots"" for the programme.[35] In contrast to most Black Mirror instalments, however, is the episode's happy ending.[17][33]

""Demon 79"" is set during the 1979 United Kingdom general election, which led to Conservative Margaret Thatcher becoming Prime Minister. Brooker said that the election saw a change in British politics, with a ""populist tsunami"" that led the world to become ""more hawkish"". Smart resembles the politician Enoch Powell.[39] He uses indirect phrases such as ""crime is on the rise"" and ""the neighbourhood is changing"" to allude to racist ideas.[32] Political themes have appeared in the series before, in ""The National Anthem"" and ""The Waldo Moment"".[40] As in ""The National Anthem"", a character is blackmailed into immoral acts for a greater good.[14]

As foreshadowing, Nida discovers old newspaper headlines describing a series of murders and a May Day celebration—this implies that Possett, the department store founder, previously used the talisman.[13][41] ""Demon 79"" is connected to other Black Mirror episodes with Easter egg references: the talisman is engraved with a symbol first seen in ""White Bear"" that accompanies malicious power.[41] Other series six episodes make brief references to Smart and a pedophile ring in Tipley.[42]

The soundtrack includes two Boney M songs: ""Rasputin"" (1978) and ""Ma Baker"" (1977). The latter signifies that Nida ""has shed her meek demeanor and is ready to kill"", according to Den of Geek's Brynna Arens, as the lyrics inform the listener that ""Ma Baker is the FBI's most wanted woman"".[43] In the same scene, Nida steals a red leather jacket: Vasan said its ""explosive pop of colour"" contrasts with the many shades of brown in the shoe department.[12] It shows a change from her initial decision to wear all-brown and ""blend into the background"".[19] Her subsequent attack on Smart is more aggressive and less hesitant than her previous killings, although she is unwilling to hurt Len and fails to kill Smart.[32] Len fits 1970s tropes, as a police officer with a moustache who leaves cigarette ash on a corpse.[17]

Viewers are led to question whether Gaap is real or if Nida is imagining the events. Nida and Vicky both mention dreaming, as does the song ""Bright Eyes"" (1979) by Art Garfunkel. Nida reads Shakti Gawain's Creative Visualisation: Use the Power of Your Imagination To Create What You Want in Life (1978).[17] During her police interrogation, the talisman takes the form of a domino, suggesting Nida's account of events is unreliable. However, the apocalyptic ending vindicates Nida.[13]

Critics compared the premise to Knock at the Cabin (2023), an M. Night Shyamalan film.[38][44] Sam Haysom of Mashable saw resemblance to Stephen King's sci-fi novel The Dead Zone (1979). Within both works, the main character discovers that a right-wing politician is set to become the leader of their country and commit terrible acts. The main character sets out to prevent this.[45] Nida's aim—to kill three people to save many—was seen as an example of the trolley problem thought experiment by Screen Rant's Greg MacArthur.[41]

The episode achieved positive critical reception: on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, it holds an approval rating of 100% based on 13 reviews.[46] The Independent and Vulture rated it four stars out of five;[34][32] Den of Geek gave it 4.5 stars;[17] The Daily Telegraph rated it five stars.[33] Reviewers praised Essiedu and Vasan's acting: Alan Sepinwall, in Rolling Stone, described them as ""so much fun"" and ""so good"", respectively.[47] Vulture's Ben Rosenstock thought they had ""great chemistry"" and The New York Observer's Laura Babiak called them the ""most watchable pair"" of the series.[32][48] Leila Jordan praised their ""thoroughly entertaining"" shifts between comedy and horror in Paste.[49]

Gaap's characterisation was particularly highlighted for praise, with The Guardian's Stuart Heritage attributing the episode's success to Essiedu.[50] Den of Geek's Louisa Mellor compared Gaap to the angel Clarence Odbody in the film It's a Wonderful Life (1946).[17] Amy West, reviewing for GamesRadar+, said that Gaap's ""deliciously camp flair"" was aided by ""one of the most fabulously flamboyant costumes"" in the programme.[51] Emily Baker of i positively reviewed the ""hilarious delivery and ostentatious clobber"" of Essiedu,[40] while Variety's Daniel D'Addario commented that Gaap is charismatic.[44] King described Gaap as exemplifying Essiedu's acting range, through expressions of exasperation and bemusement.[35] Andrew Webster of The Verge summarised that Gaap's ""ray of positivity"" provides well-timed levity.[37]

Vasan as Nida was also lauded. Rosenstock found Nida ""easily the most compelling protagonist"" of series six.[32] D'Addario praised her ""wide-eyed gumption"" and Vasan's ability to ""think through, onscreen"", the ethical quandaries and limits of what Nida is capable of.[44] West found that Vasan balanced comedy with pathos.[51] Webster wrote that Nida develops naturally as a character throughout the story.[37]

""Demon 79"" was praised for its tone. Heritage reviewed that it was a ""successful experiment"" for Black Mirror and King saw it as the best episode for many years.[35][50] Webster believed that it found a ""unique voice"" even though the premise was not original.[37] Rosenstock said the episode achieved the ""perfect tonal balance"" between funny and dramatic.[32] Babiak praised the ""genre flare"" such as the opening titles, grainy camera and gore.[48] Radio Times's James Hibbs praised that it ""brilliantly weaves in social commentary throughout"".[52] However, Jordan reviewed that the 1970s horror homage and political criticism are not consistent throughout the episode or combined well.[49] Entertainment Weekly reviewers said that the episode suffered from a lack of ""tension in the central mystery"".[53] Rosenstock praised Keith's death scene as ""fascinating"", because he is ""accepting he's about to die as a punishment"".[32]

Some reviewers highlighted that the episode is longer than typical for the programme. Babiak believed that it ""gets bogged down"" by its runtime.[48] Contrastingly, Sepinwall said the episode's ""lightness forgives some of the padding"".[47] Rosenstock approved of the episode's conclusion, which vindicates Nida and allows a happy ending despite nuclear apocalypse.[32] Babiak found it ""refreshing"" that the episode provides a ""twisted sense of catharsis"" more than a moral.[48] On the other hand, Esquire's Brady Langmann criticised the ending as ""puzzling"" and Vulture's Charles Bramesco described it as a ""cop-out whimper"" that ""undercuts the moral scale-tapping preceding it"".[54][55]

""Demon 79"" ranked below average on critics' lists of the 28 instalments of Black Mirror, from best to worst:



GamesRadar+ and IndieWire listed the 27 episodes, excluding Bandersnatch, where ""Demon 79"" placed 20th and 22nd, respectively.[51][59] The New York Observer rated it third-best of the five episodes in series six.[48]
