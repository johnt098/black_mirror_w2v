Be Right Back,"

""Be Right Back"" is the first episode of the second series of British science fiction anthology series Black Mirror. It was written by series creator and showrunner Charlie Brooker, directed by Owen Harris, and first aired on Channel 4 on 11 February 2013.

The episode tells the story of Martha (Hayley Atwell), a young woman whose boyfriend Ash Starmer (Domhnall Gleeson) is killed in a car accident. As she mourns him, she discovers that technology now allows her to communicate with an artificial intelligence imitating Ash, and reluctantly decides to try it. ""Be Right Back"" had two sources of inspiration: the question of whether to delete a dead friend's phone number from one's contacts and the idea that Twitter posts could be made by software mimicking dead people.

""Be Right Back"" explores the theme of grief and tells a melancholy story similar to the previous episode, ""The Entire History of You"". The episode received highly positive reviews, with the performances of Atwell and Gleeson receiving universal acclaim. Some hailed it as the best episode of Black Mirror, though the ending divided critics. Several real-life artificial intelligence products have been compared to the one shown in the episode, including a Luka chatbot that was partially inspired by the episode, and a planned Amazon Alexa feature designed to imitate dead loved ones.

Martha Powell (Hayley Atwell) and Ash Starmer (Domhnall Gleeson) are a young couple who have moved to Ash's remote family house in the countryside. The day after moving in, Ash is killed while returning the hired van. At the funeral, Martha's friend Sarah (Sinead Matthews) talks about a new online service which helped her in a similar situation. Martha yells at her, but Sarah signs Martha up anyway. After discovering she is pregnant, Martha reluctantly tries it out. Using all of Ash's past online communications and social media profiles, the service creates a new virtual ""Ash"". Starting out with instant messaging, Martha uploads more videos and photos and begins to talk with the artificial Ash over the phone. Martha takes it on countryside walks, talking to it constantly while neglecting her sister's messages and calls.

At a checkup, Martha hears her child's heartbeat, and on her way out accidentally drops her phone and temporarily loses contact with the artificial Ash. After consoling her, the artificial Ash tells her about the service's experimental stage. Following his instructions, Martha turns a blank, synthetic body into an android that looks almost identical to Ash. From the moment the android is activated, Martha is uncomfortable and struggles to accept its existence. Despite the android satisfying her sexually, she is concerned by his inability to sleep and absence of Ash's negative personality traits. One night, she orders the robot Ash to leave and is annoyed that he does so, as the real Ash would have resisted. The next morning, Martha takes the artificial Ash to a cliff and orders him to jump off. As he begins to follow the order, Martha expresses her frustration that Ash would not have simply obeyed. The android begs for its life. Martha screams.

Several years later, it is Martha's daughter's (Indira Ainger) birthday. Martha keeps the Ash android locked in the attic and only allows her daughter to see the android on weekends, but she makes an exception for her birthday. Her daughter chats away to the android while Martha stands at the bottom of the attic steps, and forces herself to join them.

""Be Right Back"" was the first episode of the second series of Black Mirror, produced by Zeppotron for Endemol. It aired on Channel 4 on 11 February 2013.[1] On 22 January 2013, a trailer for the second series was released, featuring ""a dream sequence"", a ""repetitive factory setting"" and a ""huge dust cloud"". The advert ran on Channel 4 and in cinemas.[2] A trailer for ""Be Right Back"" first aired on 1 February 2013.[3] The episode's title was later invoked as a tagline for the interactive film Black Mirror: Bandersnatch.[4]

The episode was written by series creator Charlie Brooker. A few months after the death of a person he knew, Brooker was removing unneeded contacts from his phone, and considered it to be ""weirdly disrespectful"" to delete their name. This idea later became an inspiration for ""Be Right Back"", along with another idea Brooker had when using Twitter: ""what if these people were dead and it was software emulating their thoughts?""[5]

Prior to the writing of ""Be Right Back"", Brooker had read about the 1960s artificial intelligence program ELIZA, and how the creator's secretary was engaged in a very personal conversation with ELIZA within minutes of first testing it.[6] Brooker also considered the inauthenticity of social media users, commenting in another interview that ""I found myself being inauthentic on there and it reminded me of writing columns for a newspaper"".[7] In 2013, Brooker said that he rationed his Twitter usage as it caused him unhappiness.[5]

Several years ago, someone I knew died, and a few months later I was going through my phone, making some space by deleting numbers. It felt weirdly disrespectful to delete this person's name. Then last year after we had a baby I spent a lot of time up late and on Twitter, thinking: what if these people were dead and it was software emulating their thoughts? And if you're grieving, if you've got something you know isn't the person, but evokes enough memories to remind you of them, is that enough?

Charlie Brooker, Interview with Time Out.[5]

The episode was written shortly after Brooker had his first child with Konnie Huq. The couple took it in turns to watch the baby whilst the other slept, and Brooker wrote the episode during his shifts. The script was written quickly, and Brooker commented that having recently had a baby led the writing to be ""more soppy and emotional"" than it may otherwise have been.[8]

In a British Film Institute panel, Brooker notes that the episode mirrors stages of internet dating, progressing from text conversations to phone calls to real-life interactions, and believes the ""biggest leap"" to be the synthetic flesh version of Ash, while the rest is ""not that far-fetched"". Executive producer Annabel Jones compares the technology to mediumship, as both are used for comfort.[6]

An unused idea for the episode was to emphasise the financial nature of the artificial intelligence company. Brooker says in an interview that ""there was a point where she runs out of credit and has to top it up. I think that was even shot"".[7] Another idea was for the episode to feature other characters and their android replacements of loved ones.[9]

Hayley Atwell, who plays Martha, was a fan of the first series of the show, calling it ""inventive and very smart"", so she asked her agent to get her a part in the second series. Atwell's first impression of the script was that it was ""really poignant, but it still had the wit.""[10] Asked in a 2013 interview, Atwell said that she was a heavy user of the internet.[5] Domhnall Gleeson plays Ash, and said in a 2018 interview that the role led him to try to use his phone less, with a stage direction where he frantically searches his phone particularly resonating with him.[11]

The episode was directed by Owen Harris, who later directed the series-three episode ""San Junipero""[12] â€“ an episode which Harris described as ""strangely similar"" to this one as both are ""relationship-led"".[13] Harris was drawn to ""Be Right Back"" by its ""intimate"" exploration of ""grander themes of love and death and loss"".[8] Brooker believes that Harris is ""very good with performers"" and ""gravitates"" towards Black Mirror episodes that are ""more tender"". Brooker praises Harris' ""good eye for those authentic, bittersweet and painful moments.""[14] He describes that the story ""on the one hand is about technology and on the other hand is about grief"".[6] Vince Pope composed the episode's soundtrack.

Atwell was keen to keep Martha grounded and use naturalism to emphasise Martha's grief and make the science fiction concepts more plausible. Harris describes Martha as a ""girl next door"" character, whose goal was to lead a ""simple life"" with Ash. Before filming, Atwell and Gleeson met at Dans le Noir, a restaurant in which food is served in darkness.[8]

Harris wished to make the episode appear as if it could be possible in the near future, as if one could ""walk into the Mac store tomorrow and it wouldn't be out of place to see people trialling software like this"".[6] Production designer Joel Collins said in 2018 that the technology is ""almost real now"", but ""seemed fantastical"" at the time. The petrol station has ""micro cars"", which Collins suggests are electric cars that could be a part of a ""simple, small, eco-friendly"" future.[8] A touch-screen easel is shown briefly in the episode. Brooker commented that ""the design team had a field day with that easel"" and that they suggested copyrighting the idea.[15] Brooker wished to avoid a trope of ""histrionic"" technology interfaces in television, using more subtle cues such as Martha deleting an email on her touch-free laptop with a simple hand movement. One email sent to Martha is a targeted advertisement for books about dealing with grief.[16]

Harris has said that different endings were discussed, but that ""I think we pretty much ended up where we'd started"". Harris suggested a family dinner downstairs, but Brooker and Jones preferred for Martha to allow her daughter to see Ash once per week. Atwell described the ending as ""very pessimistic"", calling her character ""numb"" and perhaps ""medicated"". During filming for the final scene, Gleeson had begun to grow a beard for another project; though there was debate over whether the android could have a beard to mark the passage of time, it was removed in editing. This was a difficult and expensive process, as Ash has to talk and walk through shadows and light.[8]

""Be Right Back"" has grief as a central concept, according to Emily Yoshida of Grantland and James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly.[17][18] Luke Owen of Flickering Myth summarised the episode as a ""sombre, low-key and all together depressing affair about grief and how people deal with it in different ways"",[19] with Giles Harvey of The New Yorker commenting on the episode's exploration of postmodern grief possibilities, suggesting that a targeted email to Martha about grief ""stands for an accumulation of such intrusive momentsâ€”the death of solitude by a thousand digital cuts"".[16] Other themes in the episode are also present. Ryan Lambie of Den of Geek believed the episode's theme to be ""technology's effects on relationships"".[20] Johnston noted that in addition to grief, the episode explores how people behave in ""increasingly mediated public spaces"".[21]

The episode was described by Brooker as ""a ghost story""[7] and many critics have commented on its tone. David Sims of The A.V. Club described it as a ""spare, haunting piece"",[22] though Megan Logan of Inverse said that whilst episode is tragic it does contain a ""deep-seated optimism"".[23] Focusing on the interconnection of content and tone, Charles Bramesco of Vulture wrote that the episode amalgamates a ""cerebral sci-fi thought [experiment]"" and a ""sentimental core"", making it a ""high-concept tearjerker"".[24] Tom Sutcliffe of The Independent connected the episode's tone to a development in Brooker's writing since his marriage and first child, calling it ""tender"" and ""wistful"".[25]

Unlike past episodes of Black Mirror, ""Be Right Back"" features a character beginning to use a technology, rather than one who is used to it.[17] According to Daniel M. Swain of HuffPost, the episode is a ""powerful reminder to the soullessness of social media"",[26] and Sameer Rahim of The Daily Telegraph wrote that the episode contains ideas about the falsity of social media personas and growing addiction to the internet.[27] Roxanne Sancto of Paste said the episode ""examines our own mortality and our desire to play God"", and demonstrates how humans have a ""desperate need to reverse a natural and necessary part of life without considering the consequences"".[28]

Other critics posed their thoughts more on the relationship in the episode, and suggested it was relationship-led. According to Lambie, Ash is ""an affectionate boyfriend"" and Martha is ""blissfully in love"", though Ash is easily distracted by his phone; Martha and Ash only appear together in a few scenes, but we see their love through ""little in-jokes, shared love of cheesy 70s tunes and childhood memories"".[20] Bojalad wrote that they are ""one of the most realistically comfortable and happy couples"" in the series,[29] and Owen agreed, writing that though the relationship has little screentime, the audience feel ""an instant connection with them"".[19] These scenes are later mirrored: examples include the android Ash disliking the Bee Gees and engaging in sex that feels ""robotic"".[30] Ash's cause of death is ""neither clear nor important"", though Sims and Sancto thought that it relates to him checking his phone while driving.[22][28]

Yoshida said that the presence of the android Ash is ""menacing"" though he has a ""docile"" demeanour, further commenting that Martha is unable to resist him, despite her repulsion at the situation.[17] Sims stated that the replica of Ash is ""self-aware"", as it ""knows it cannot replace Ash fully"". Sims also described the robotic Ash as ""like a lost puppy"" who follows Martha obediently.[22] Swain noted this non-humanness, too, writing that though the android Ash is witty, his personality lacks meaning,[26] with Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy calling him ""hollow"" and commenting that he is missing ""so much of what made Ash the man he was"".[30] Logan said the episode is about ""the intangibles of humanness that make up the people we love"".[23] Sutcliffe believed the robotic Ash fails as a replacement because humans miss their loved ones' ""sourness"" as well as their ""sweetness"".[25]

In contrast to the previous series opener, ""The National Anthem"", Brooker described ""Be Right Back"" as ""more earnest than people might expect"" as well as ""melancholy"" and ""very intimate and personal"".[10] Lambie made similar comments.[20] Lambie and Jeffery both compared the episode to ""The Entire History of You"", an episode from the first series written by Jesse Armstrong.[20][30] Yoshida noted that ""The Entire History of You"" begins with Liam obsessing over a job interview, which he is able to replay through his grain device. Yoshida compared his inability to drop the matter with Martha's choice to ""forever nurse herself on a slow drip of delayed acceptance"" by replacing Ash with an android.[17] Maura Johnston of The Boston Globe said that both episodes have memory as a central concept and ""[play] on the ideas of love and the ideal"".[21]

Richard Hand of The Conversation described the episode as a ""clever reworking"" of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.[31] Yoshida compared the artificial Ash to Frankenstein's monster,[17] with Hand making the same comparison, writing that both are ""resurrected figure[s]"" that ""can never be human"".[31] While Frankenstein demonstrates that the ""vital essence of humanity"" is more than a collection of body parts, ""Be Right Back"" shows it is not the ""digital presence"" of a person.[31]

Reviewers have used the analogy of ""Be Right Back"" being like ""The Monkey's Paw"" with futuristic technology.[32][18] Lambie compared the storyline to Ubik by Philip K. Dick and the 1984 film Starman, and the cinematography to 2010 film Never Let Me Go.[20] TheWrap noted that the episode ""shares some similarities"" with 2013 film Her.[33]

In 2015, Luka co-founder Eugenia Kuyda used her AI startup resources to build an online service using chat logs from her late friend Roman Mazurenko; ""Be Right Back"" was one of the sources of inspiration for the project.[34] Having seen the episode after her friend's death, she questioned of the concept: ""Is it letting go, by forcing you to actually feel everything? Or is it just having a dead person in your attic?"" The Roman Mazurenko chatbot was launched in May 2016 and was met with mostly positive responses, though four of Kuyda's friends were disturbed by the project and one commented that she had ""failed to learn the lesson of the Black Mirror episode"".[35] Another company, Eterni.me, also produces AI that has been compared to the robot Ash in ""Be Right Back""; cofounder Marius Ursache has commented that the company is trying to avoid ""the concept that it's a way for grieving loved ones to stall moving on"" and that the AI depicted in this episode is a ""creepier version"" of their ideas.[36][37] Similar bots such as BINA48, made public in 2010 by Martine Rothblatt, or the 2017 ""DadBot"" made by journalist James Vlahos, have also been compared to the central conceit in this episode.[38][39][40]

Comparisons were drawn from a planned feature for Amazon's voice assistant Alexa to ""Be Right Back"" in June 2022, after a demonstration at their Re:MARS conference.[41][42] Functionality under development would allow Alexa to impersonate a person's voice from around a minute of audio. The executive introducing the plans, Rohit Prasad, recommended that it be used to mimic dead loved ones; an example was shown of Alexa imitating a grandmother's voice to read a story to a grandchild.[42][43] He said, ""While AI can't eliminate that pain of loss, it can definitely make their memories last"".[44]

One professor of internet studies, Tama Leaver, compared the planned Alexa concept to the episode and said he understood how the feature would be tempting. However, he raised concerns over people conflating machines with people, a lack of consent of the person whose voice is featured, and audio ownership rights issues.[43] The computer science professor Subbarao Kambhampati said that the potential to help people grieveâ€”as with replaying videos of dead loved onesâ€”needed to be assessed against moral questions raised by the technology.[44] Other criticism focuses on potential applications for cybercriminals and fraudsters, who use deepfake technology that adds somebody's likeness to audio or video.[43][44] Hamish Hector of TechRadar reviewed that ""blurring the lines between life and death doesn't seem like the healthiest way to deal with loss"" and that the technology differs from reviewing old photos and videos due to consent of the depicted and the absence of fabrication in the content.[45]

First airing on Channel 4 on 11 February 2013 at 10Â p.m., the episode garnered 1.6Â million viewers, a 9% share of the audience. This was 14% higher than the time slot's average for the channel, but a lower figure than the 1.9 million viewers who watched ""The National Anthem"", the previous series' first episode.[46] In 2014, the episode was nominated for the BAFTA TV Award for Best Single Drama.[47]

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the episode holds an approval rating of 93% based on 14 reviews, with an average rating of 8.30/10. The website's critics consensus reads: ""'Be Right Back' tones down Black Mirror's typically dark humour, but its examination of grief in the age of social media makes it an exceptionally powerful episode.""[48] The A.V. Club gave the episode an Aâˆ’ rating.[22] Out of five stars, the episode received four stars in The Daily Telegraph[27] and Digital Spy.[30] Empire ranked the first meeting between Martha and the Ash android as one of the 50 greatest sci-fi moments in fiction.[49] Prior to the premiere of series 3, Logan claimed that the episode was ""the best episode of the series so far"" and the ""most heartbreaking"".[23] Rahim said that the episode is ""a touching exploration of grief"" and opined that ""it's the best thing Brooker has done"".[27] Following the fourth series, Alec Bojalad of Den of Geek opined that it is the best episode of the show.[29]

Logan praised the storyline as a ""stunning, linear meditation on grief and love"". Lambie believed that the limited scope of the episode ""intensifies its dramatic strength"", and praised it as ""appropriately haunting"".[23] Contrastingly, Mike Higgins of The Independent criticised that the episode failed in its aims as a ""social-media satire"".[32] Jeffery praised the tone as ""creepy and moving in equal measure"".[30] Sims commented that the narrative arc is ""engrossing"" despite its predictability.[22]

Jeffery criticised the episode's ending as a ""cop-out"" from Brooker because ""like Martha, you get the feeling that he doesn't quite know what to do with Ash now that he's created him.""[30] Owen found that the ending ""doesn't really conclude any of Martha's character progression"",[19] while Higgins wrote that ""Ash has become just another sci-fi stock robot"".[32] However, Sims praised the final scene as emotive and ""melancholy"".[22]

Owen reviewed that Hayley Atwell's performance as Martha was the best in Black Mirror up to that point in the programme,[19] with Lambie agreeing that it was one of the best.[20] Lambie wrote that Atwell is ""the hub of almost every scene""[20] and Sims found that she ""almost never [lets] her grief feel cartoonish or clichÃ©d"".[22] Owen called Domnhall Gleeson's acting as Ash ""equally as great"",[19] while Sims commented of the climax that ""[i]t's amazing to watch Gleeson turn the emotions on after keeping them bottled in for an entire episode"".[22] Lambie opined that Ash and Martha have ""a real spark""[20] and Jeffery praised that the episode ""has real heart and characters that live and breathe"".[30]

Owen praised Owen Harris' directing, reviewing that the familiar surroundings and credible technology ""[added] to the believability of the story.""[19] Bojalad wrote that the scene in which the police arrive to inform Martha of Ash's death is ""among the most artful and devastating moments Black Mirror has ever presented"".[29] Higgins praised the cinematography in the countryside scene.[32]

""Be Right Back"" appeared on many critics' rankings of the 19 episodes in Black Mirror, from best to worst:



Instead of by quality, Proma Khosla of Mashable ranked the episodes by tone, concluding that ""Be Right Back"" is the fourth-least pessimistic episode of the show.[57]

Other critics ranked the 13 episodes in Black Mirror's first three series.



Other reviewers ranked the seven episodes produced under Channel 4. ""Be Right Back"" is listed fifth in a Metro article by Jon O'Brien,[64] and ranked sixth-best by Roxanne Sancto of Paste.[28]
"
White Bear,"

""White Bear"" is the second episode of the second series of the British science fiction anthology series Black Mirror. It was written by the series creator and showrunner Charlie Brooker and directed by Carl Tibbetts. The episode follows Victoria (Lenora Crichlow), a woman who does not remember who she is, and wakes up in a place where almost everybody is controlled by a television signal. Along with some of the few other unaffected people (Michael Smiley and Tuppence Middleton), she must stop the ""White Bear"" transmitter while surviving merciless pursuers.

Brooker originally wrote the episode in an apocalyptic setting, but when the script was about to be filmed at a former Royal Air Force base, he changed it because of a fence he saw there. He rewrote the story in two days, removing some details he considered useful for a sequel story. The main change was the addition of a plot twist at the end of the script, which was noted as the most impressive aspect of the episode by several reviewers.

The episode, first aired on Channel 4 on 18 February 2013, was watched by 1.2 million viewers and was very well received by critics, particularly for its writing and Middleton's performance. The story draws parallels with real murder cases, primarily the 1960s Moors murders, in which five children were killed. Its horror aspects have been said to be reminiscent of the 1970s film The Wicker Man and the video game Manhunt, while some similarities with The Twilight Zone have also been noted. This dystopian episode reflects upon several aspects of contemporary society, such as media coverage of murders, technology's effects on people's empathy, desensitisation, violence as entertainment, vigilantism, the concept of justice and punishment, and the nature of reality.

A woman (Lenora Crichlow) wakes up with amnesia, in a house where television screens are showing an unknown symbol. Turning the screens off, she finds photos of herself and a man (Nick Ofield), along with one of a small girl (Imani Jackman) which she takes with her. She leaves the house and pleads for help, but people ignore her while recording her on their phones. When a masked man opens fire at her with a shotgun, she flees and meets Jem (Tuppence Middleton). Jem explains that the symbol began appearing on television and mobile phone screens, turning most people into passive voyeurs. The woman and Jem are unaffected, but they are also a target for the ""hunters"", unaffected humans who act sadistically. Jem plans to reach a transmitter at ""White Bear"" to destroy it.

As they travel, Baxter (Michael Smiley), a man who also seems unaffected, picks them up. He turns out to be another hunter, and holds them at gunpoint in a forest, where he tries to torture the woman, but Jem kills Baxter first. They continue travelling to the transmitter; when they reach it, two hunters attack them. The woman wrestles a shotgun away from a hunter and fires at her attacker, but the gun only sprays confetti. Walls open to reveal a seated audience; and that everything was staged, and Baxter is not only alive, but the event's master of ceremonies.

The woman is strapped to a chair and informed that her name is Victoria Skillane, and that the girl in the photograph is Jemima Sykes, whom Victoria and her fiancÃ©, Iain Rannoch, had abducted and murdered, filming the crime. After the pair were arrested, Iain committed suicide in his cell, while Victoria was sentenced to undergo daily psychological punishment at the present facility, which is called White Bear Justice Park after a white teddy bear that Jemima owned.

Victoria is driven back to the compound past an outraged crowd and returned to where she awoke. As she is shown her own videotaped footage of Jemima prior to her murder, Baxter places electrodes on her head, simultaneously torturing her and wiping her memory of the day's events so that she will live the same day repeatedly as part of her punishment. Interspersed between the end credits, the next day's events are seen from the point of view of the park's staff, and its visitors who play the voyeurs.

Series creator Charlie Brooker came up with the idea while working on the 2008 zombie horror serial Dead Set. During filming, Riz Ahmed's character was being chased by zombies; some schoolchildren noticed the production and began watching, taking pictures on their phones.[3] Brooker considered it to be ""an interesting and frightening image, because they're standing there, not intervening"". Brooker converted it to a script for Dead Set, in which a photograph goes viral on social media and ""unlock[s] this primal urge for people to be voyeurs of agony"". Although the idea was given the green light, they did not have the budget to do it.[4]

The first conception of the episode was as ""a straightforward apocalypse story"", featuring a female journalist[5] and taking inspiration from the 1967 science fiction horror film Quatermass and the Pit.[3] The signal would have affected people all over the world,[6] turning 90% of them into voyeurs and the rest into mad people who attacked each other; its source was never explained.[3] It was to end with a public crucifixion.[5]

The second version opened with a patient speaking to their psychiatrist about their nightmares and a recent urge to commit violence. The patient draws a glyph from their dreams, and the psychiatrist files it along with identical symbols drawn by her other patients. This glyph resembles an upside-down ""Y"" and was created by Brooker after much experimentation; it is the one used in the final episode. This draft had the character Baxter in it and resembled the 1973 horror film The Wicker Man. Executive producer Annabel Jones noted that the theme had shifted more towards voyeurism. By this point, director Carl Tibbetts was involved with the project.[3]

After working on the other series two episodes ""Be Right Back"" and ""The Waldo Moment"", the latter of which was in production, there was little of the budget remaining for ""White Bear"". Filming was limited to a military base at RAF Daws Hill in southeast England, which was formerly a United States Air Force base. The base contained an abandoned housing estate and buildings that could be repurposed to look like shops and garages. The base was surrounded by chicken wire and Brooker considered that the fence could be there because the events of the episode were not real. Brooker believed that the public would watch certain people be tortured for entertainmentâ€Šâ€”â€Šsuch as Jimmy Savile, against whom hundreds of sexual abuse allegations have been made, or Myra Hindley, a serial killer who committed the Moors murders with her boyfriend, Ian Brady.[3]

Brooker then rewrote the script in two days ""in a bit of a fever dream"".[6][5] He noted that he had never changed a script so dramatically so late in the production process,[6] and that this is the first major plot twist in a Black Mirror episode. Brooker considered making Victoria innocent, but settled on making her unknowingly guilty. Lenora Crichlow had already been cast as Victoria prior to the rewrite.[3]

Prior to the twist, the episode is shown from Victoria's perspective. According to Tibbetts, handheld cameras were used to make the episode ""very intense and personal"" and to make the viewer identify with Victoria. Contrastingly, in the end credits scenes filming is ""still and static"" to resemble an observer's perspective. Flashback scenes were balanced to avoid giving away too much information before the twist. The scene in which Victoria is driven through the crowd was cut shorter in the final edit and many of the crowd members were added digitally. Brooker had the idea during editing of displaying Victoria's next day at the park during the credits. The episode is 42 minutes long, slightly shorter than Channel 4's standard of 45â€“48 minutes for an hour-long episode.[3]

The episode's soundtrack was composed by Jon Opstad. The score is mostly electronic. To give a different character to the music played as Victoria lives her next day in the theme park, Opstad added acoustic elements, but feeling that this did not fit with the universe he used pizzicato cello music and overlaid ""spidery"" atonal lines.[3]

Brooker had other ideas that were removed from the original script because they would be complicated to do. He said he could use these ideas in a sequel story which would involve the main character finding messages that she had left for herself on previous days as the process of erasing her mind starts not to function. However, as the location for the episode no longer exists, he felt it would be more practical to create a graphic novel instead of recreating the scenario.[5]

Many reviewers identified an allusion to the Moors murders, committed by Ian Brady and Myra Hindley, a British couple who killed children in the 1960s.[7][8][9] The A.V. Club's David Sims emphasised the similarities between Victoria's video recording and the fact that Hindley audio-taped the torture of one of her and Brady's victims.[7]

""It delivers one level of horror, and then the trapdoor opens and there are several additional levels of horror. In some way that must confirm to you that the world is a horrible place because it presents a society in which the world is a horrible place. If you're neurotic and fearful, then maybe ""White Bear"" tickles that synapse. But it's reassuring, in some way, to watch films that reveal society to be insane and heartless. It's like the filmmakers are saying, 'We're not saying that this is a realistic portrayal. It's a chilling nightmare'.""

â€”Charlie Brooker, series creator[10]

The influence of horror works was highlighted by critics and Brooker himself. Lambie found aspects of the forest scene reminiscent of 1970s exploitation films. He also felt there are several visual and thematic parallels to The Wicker Man and Kill List.[8] Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy agreed it is reminiscent of zombies and slasher films ""and even has that unsettling Wicker Man feel with its notion of 'society gone wrong'.""[11] Brooker commented it is indeed ""a Wicker Manâ€“style horror"",[12] and Tibbetts commented that the film was ""a big touchstone"" for him.[3] Because they have similar concepts, 28 Days Later and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre were also mentioned by reviewers as possible influences.[13][14][15] Paul Brian McCoy of Comics Bulletin stated it ""recalls any number of zombie apocalypse dramas, including Brooker's own Dead Set at times"" and The Signal.[1] While Brooker said the hunters' design was inspired by the horror video game Manhunt,[16] McCoy felt its opening echoed another game, Resident Evil.[1]

The Twilight Zone has been seen as an influence by some reviewers. Jeffery commented that Black Mirror's ""roots in"" the American anthology series ""have never been more visible"",[11] while Sims noted that ""White Bear"" is ""the most Twilight Zone-y episode of the show"",[7] and James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly said it could even have been an episode of that series.[17] Lyndsey Weber of Vulture made a ""post-viewing guide"" to Black Mirror, where she included The Twilight Zone episode ""Five Characters in Search of an Exit"" as ""bonus watching"" to ""White Bear"".[18]

Despite the similarities to real murder cases, David Sims noted the focus is not any single case, arguing that when an ""abhorrent crime"" occurs people create ""totem[s] of hatred and evil"" from the figures involved in the crime. He said Brooker examines what he calls the ""lurid media frenzy"" trend.[7] Lambie, as well as Aubrey Page of Collider, considered it was mainly directed towards tabloids' coverage of criminal cases that turns them into ""witch hunts"".[8][19] Simon Cocks of Screen Anarchy agreed it is an allegory of the Internet, but also a discussion on how society processes information and treats shocking news stories.[20] Paste's Roxanne Sancto wrote it is aimed at the media's tendency ""to turn horrific news stories into national spectacles, riling people up to the point of mass panic and violence in the process"".[21] Alfred Joyner of International Business Times stated ""the argument is that in the media notorious criminals must be demonised to appease the public's insatiable appetite to see that 'justice' is served"".[2]

James Poniewozik of The New York Times identified vigilantism as a central concept in the story.[22] Writing for Esquire, Corey Atad commented it is about the societal ""appetite for punishment"",[13] while Sam Parker of The Huffington Post and Andrew Liptak of The Verge considered it represents ""a cruel society's fantasy of 'real justice'""[14] and a ""perverted justice"" respectively.[23] More specifically, it deals with the remote punishment done via the anonymity of the Internet, according to some of TheWrap's staff members and Page.[19][24] While Sims stated there are parallels between Victoria's suffering and the crime she committed,[7] Joyner considered these parallels to be central to the episode's critique.[2] When her crime is revealed, Joyner wrote, ""the construction of the White Bear centre becomes apparent now, as a real-life karmic experience for the general public who wish to see biblical retribution"".[2] Mark Monahan of The Telegraph wrote that the episode ""mocked, above all, our insatiable, voyeuristic, neo-Medieval thirst for supposedly 'real-life' pain and humiliation repackaged as entertainment"".[9] Jeffery stated it depicted how society turns horror into entertainment,[11] and Parker concluded, ""The fact Victoria was a murderer allows them to accept her suffering, but it's the mobile phones that allow them to enjoy itâ€”after all, she's just a character on their screens.""[14]

Liptak said it portrays people as victims of technology,[23] while Joyner commented it denotes that ""the way in which we are spoon-fed an almost constant stream of information through technology has turned us into passive consumers"".[2] Joyner believes that Brooker implicates the viewer with the story's credits scene, noting ""we're the ones with the smartphones, passively absorbing abuses to human rights and decency, and yet revelling in the image from the safety of the screen"".[2] Jeffery and Parker theorised it contains the idea that people are preferring to document life rather than living it, as exemplified by ""people who see violence break out ... and decide to film it rather than intervene.""[11][14] Leigh Alexander of Boing Boing said the episode reflects how violence is easily accessed on the Internet and quickly arouses people's attention. She noted, ""you can view the episode as a critique of all kinds of themes: Mob mentality, reality television, even the complicated treatment of women in the justice system ... Primarily, though, this episode is a critique of our deep, often-unexamined mass desensitisation, or at least a dread portent of its potential to grow. It aims to ask: To what extent can you stand by and watch horror before you are complicit, punishable?""[25]

Brooker commented that after watching the episode, the viewer feels ""sympathetic towards [Victoria] but also repulsed by what [she] did"". Tibbetts opined that the episode is ""about not torturing people"" and Victoria's guilt is irrelevant to whether one should take pleasure from her torture.[3] Sims said Victoria's suffering was shown to make the viewer sympathise with her, but noted it is difficult to do so because she committed an unforgivable crime, although her mental state is not entirely clear because of the fact ""her mind has been erased so many times that the crime is barely a memory"".[7] Lambie stated it was done to explore ""how human empathy breaks down when individuals are reduced to an image on a screen"", and concluded, ""whether it's directed at the innocent or the guilty, cruelty is still cruelty"".[8] Atad asserted it ultimately leads viewers to choose between their ""so-called justice and the competing value of empathy"".[13] Writing for Sabotage Times, Gareth Dimelow concluded it leaves the viewer to ponder: ""If someone has no recollection of their crimes, can they be effectively punished? Does our societal bloodlust for vengeance make us just as dangerous as the criminals we seek to discipline?""[26] GamesRadar's Richard Edwards found that Brooker was able to present a ""morally complex idea"" without taking a side on the discussion.[15] Sancto felt the episode ""plays with the viewer's emotions ... making it all the more difficult to find a moral stance on her story in the end"".[21]

Jones interpreted that Victoria is ""incredibly remorseful"" once she learns who she is, saying that Victoria's knowledge of what she did to the young girl is ""obviously destroying her"". In contrast, Brooker believes Victoria to only be feeling ""confusion and animal fear"" as her life is like ""a nightmare in which society tells you're a child killer"".[3]

Joyner stated the episode uses ""the idea of having what the viewers are led to believe as reality exposed as a sham"".[2] Alexander suggested this could be interpreted as questioning ""the assumptions we bring to the things we see â€“ we can capture nearly any issue from all angles and pin it to virtual glass forever, but still only own a piece of the story, the unknowable remainder filled in by our own preconceptions"".[25] Alasdair Stuart of Bleeding Cool commented it ""builds on this idea of the reflection that you know is fake but can't look away from and internalizes it"".[27] With the plot twist, Stuart said, ""we're shown exactly what's been a reflection of the truth all along; everything"". He also stated it questions ""our own fundamental need to be the hero or heroine of our own story"".[27]

""White Bear"" was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on Channel 4 at 10Â pm on 18 February 2013. According to the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board, the episode was viewed by an estimated 1.2 million viewers, which was 7.2% of the British audience. This was lower than the second series premiere, ""Be Right Back"", which was watched by 1.6 million people (9%).[28] Brooker opined that ""White Bear"" is definitely the episode that provides ""the most visceral, holy shit reaction from viewers"",[10] while Hibberd deemed it a ""fan-favorite"".[17]

The episode was very well received and appeared on several lists of the series' best episodes. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, it holds an approval rating of 88% based on 17 reviews, with an average rating of 8.20/10. The website's critics consensus reads: ""'White Bear' makes up for its blunt social criticism with its intense scare factor and final twist.""[29] Sancto deemed it the best episode among the first seven because its theme was presented ""in a chilling manner"".[21] Page rated it the fourth-best among the thirteen episodes, asserting that it has an ""ability to truly disturb"" and ""has put off many a viewer as spinning on a cheap twist, but despite the fact that the episode's impact does turn on a reveal, there's little in the episode that even feels remotely done before.""[19] Mat Elfring of GameSpot placed it fifth out of thirteen, labelling it ""the most successful horror episode [of the series] to date"".[30] Atad ranked it seven out of thirteen, saying it ""begins a dystopian horror reminiscent of 28 Days Later, but where it ends up is far more disturbing"".[13] Out of the thirteen, Hibberd ranked it eighth, highlighting its plot twist and noting that ""most [would] rank this episode much higher; I just happened to like the rest of the episodes better"".[17] Moreover, Stuart said it ""may be one of the best hours of TV produced [in 2013]"".[27] He emphasised how it transits from ""John Wyndham stuff"" to horror and then action, and commended its final twist. He concluded: ""The last fifteen minutes of White Bear are amongst the most blisteringly angry pieces of television I've ever seen.""[27]

It is considered to have ""one of the most shocking twists on Black Mirror"", as Jenelle Riley of Variety put it, before the third series aired.[6] Writing before the third series, Margaret Lyons of The New York Times said it is ""the most outright disturbing"" episode of Black Mirror.[31] Right after it aired, Cocks deemed it ""the single darkest episode of Black Mirror so far"" and considered its twist to be ""nothing short of genius"".[20] Sims stated that it ""is, by a significant margin, the most disturbing episode Black Mirror has produced"". Although he praised the twist as ""a smart one, brilliantly concealed and smartly revealed"", he criticised it because ""once the point is made, it is made over and over again.""[7] Lambie praised its ""fearsome pace"" and highlighted ""its subtle approach"", with sparse dialogue, that gives ""the events and performances greater impact"". He concluded: ""its horror-infused drama leaves us unsure whom we can trust or what will happen next, and its last act is truly gut-wrenching"".[8] Monahan wrote that the twist was unpredictable and the episode ""was an exciting and efficient piece of narrative rug-pulling"".[9]

Regarding the acting and the characters, Sims and Monahan praised Middleton's performance.[7][9] By contrast, Crichlow's role was considered to be repetitive. Monahan stated she just wailed,[9] and Parker called it ""a harrowing performance with no arc or resolutions, just sheer fear and distress"".[14] Lambie said: ""If there's a criticism to be levelled at the first two-thirds of White Bear, it's that Victoria's carried helplessly along by events.""[8] Simon said Crichlow's potential was wasted because of the script.[32] Jeffery criticised the fact ""Victoria maintains one emotional level across the episode ... she's tearful, panicked and terrified throughout"", but he remarked it was not Crichlow's fault, while praising Middleton and Smiley as ""uniformly excellent"".[11] Cocks was more favorable, praising Crichlow's commitment to her performance.[20] He also attributed to her performance ""one of the episode's greatest accomplishments ... how much it makes audience members feel as though they are in the position of [Victoria]"".[20] Edwards asserted she gave a ""tour de force performance"" that is ""an excellent, convincing portrayal of a frightened, confused woman"".[15]

Some reviewers had mixed feelings about the episode. Jane Simon of the Daily Mirror said that ""White Bear"" lacked the ""instant emotional tug"" of the series opener. She commented that, a third of the way through the episode, she had lost hope that it would conclude effectively, ""[...] the acting was unbelievable, the script was riddled with horror-film cliches, the violence was a bit over the top [...]"", but that by the end she was positively surprised.[32] Joyner praised it as ""stylistically ... breath-taking"" with ""intense action"", but felt ""the themes come across as particularly flat"" and ""hardly original"". He was disappointed until the twist, and concludes that Brooker has ""crafted an hour of television more bold and daring than I've seen in a long time"".[2] Jeffery said ""this is Black Mirror as full-blooded horror"" and that it never gets boring, while criticising the characters and the final sequence as ""a little overlong and obvious"".[11] TheWrap's staff was divided; while some found it has a good social critique, others considered it to be ""least effective when it goes for horror"".[24] Although Parker compared the first 45 minutes to ""a low-budget, low-quality version of 28 Days Later"", full of ""horror movie clichÃ©s"", he realised that was ""the whole point"". He was positive to its societal criticism and wrote: ""So the reason it all felt like a rubbish horror movie for 45 minutes is because that's what it was, just with a real person in the centre of it.""[14] It was ranked eleventh out of the thirteen episodes by Charles Bramesco of Vulture, who said its message is ""lost beneath a simplistic twist that pulls a switcheroo and [it] fails to do much else"".[33]


"
The Waldo Moment,"

""The Waldo Moment"" is the third episode in the second series of the British science fiction anthology television series Black Mirror. It was written by series creator and showrunner Charlie Brooker and directed by Bryn Higgins, and first aired on Channel 4 on 25 February 2013. The episode originated in an idea for Nathan Barley, an earlier TV show by Brooker and Chris Morris.

The episode tells the story of Jamie Salter (Daniel Rigby), an unhappy comedian who plays a blue animated bear called Waldo in a satirical television programme. After a politician he interviewedâ€”Liam Monroe (Tobias Menzies)â€”enters a by-election to become member of parliament, Waldo stands as a candidate. Meanwhile, Jamie and another candidate Gwendolyn Harris (Chloe Pirrie) develop feelings for each other. Waldo's popularity continues to rise, but Jamie becomes increasingly discontented with the role he is playing.

The episode is in contrast to other Black Mirror episodes with its contemporary setting; it explores public distrust of politicians. Initially based in part on the politician and future British prime minister Boris Johnson, the character of Waldo was widely compared to business magnate Donald Trump following his successful 2016 campaign to become President of the United States. The episode was considered by critics to be very poor in comparison to other Black Mirror episodes, with criticisms made of its reliance on tropes and its ending. The characters of Waldo and Jamie received mixed reception.

On a topical comedy show, Jamie Salter (Daniel Rigby) plays Waldoâ€”a vulgar, animated blue bear who interviews public figures under the pretence of a children's television programme. After Conservative politician Liam Monroe (Tobias Menzies) files a complaint over his interview, a television pilot starring Waldo is commissioned. Despite this, Jamie is unsatisfied with his life, particularly over a recent breakup. Executive Jack Napier (Jason Flemyng) notes that Monroe is standing to become a member of parliament in the by-election for the fictional constituency of Stentonford and Hersham. It is agreed that Waldo should also stand.

Appearing as Waldo via video screens on the side of a van, Jamie goads Monroe into confrontation as he campaigns. Meanwhile, Gwendolyn Harris (Chloe Pirrie) has been chosen as the Labour Party candidate, though the constituency is a safe seat for the Conservatives. Harris and Jamie get drunk together, Jamie expressing his displeasure at being stuck as Waldo and Harris admitting she will not win. They have sex and agree to continue their relationship. Harris' campaign manager Roy (Michael Shaeffer) is alarmed that she talked to Jamie, telling her that she cannot see him during the campaign.

Waldo and the other candidates are invited to a student-organised hustings, in which Monroe details Jamie's mostly unsuccessful television career and derides his message as meaningless. Jamie attacks both Monroe and Harris as disingenuous career politicians, using information Harris divulged during their encounter. Waldo's rant goes viral on YouTube and receives media coverage; Waldo is interviewed by political pundit Philip Crane (Pip Torrens). Jamie is reluctant to continue as Waldo, but does so after Jack threatens to play him instead. Afterwards, Jack and Jamie meet with American agent Jeff Carter (David Ajala), who talks about the advantages of a cartoon figurehead over a human in spreading political messages abroad.

Jamie tries to apologise to Harris, but she is furious with him. The next day, Jamie breaks character and urges everyone not to vote for Waldo; Jack assumes his role as Waldo and frivolously rants to incite a member of the public to assault Jamie. In hospital, Jamie sees the results of the election: Monroe won, Waldo was second and Harris was third, though Jack, using Waldo, incites a riot. In the final scene, a homeless Jamie is ordered to move on by the police. He sees a screen displaying Waldo on every channel, in different languages. Out of frustration, Jamie throws a bottle at it, but the police tase and attack him.

""The Waldo Moment"" was the third episode of the second series of Black Mirror, produced by Zeppotron for Endemol. It aired on Channel 4 on 25 February 2013 at 10 p.m.[1] On 22 January 2013, a trailer for the second series was released, featuring a dream sequence, a factory location and a large dust cloud. The advert ran on Channel 4 and in cinemas.[2] A trailer for ""The Waldo Moment"" premiered on 19 February 2013.[3]

The episode was written by series creator Charlie Brooker. It originates from an idea by Brooker and Chris Morris, conceived when the pair were writing Nathan Barley in 2005. They imagined a politician based on the British virtual band Gorillaz, whose members are animated cartoon characters. When Brooker came to write the episode, he took inspiration for Waldo's character on British politician Boris Johnson,[4][5] and Ali G was also an inspiration.[6] JÃ³n Gnarr, a stand-up comedian who became mayor of ReykjavÃ­k, was another reference point, and after the episode idea was conceived.[7]

Brooker said that the episode is ""asking what satire's about"". Some of Jamie's dialogue is based on Brooker's own perspective from his career, such as co-presenting 10 O'Clock Live, a political comedy which ran from 2011 to 2013.[8]

Brooker commented that the episode was rushed due to time constraints, as he was busy rewriting drafts of another series two episode, ""White Bear"". He had wanted to do more research, though he did consult with his sister-in-law Rupa Huq, a then-Labour politician. Brooker said in 2018 that the idea should have been executed in a longer format, such as a two-part episode, miniseries or movie. He also wanted Jamie to be in more jeopardy, and to further develop the idea of Waldo as a ""lightning rod for dissatisfaction with politicians"".[8] He expressed regret at rejecting the idea of having Gwendolyn and Jamie be ex-partners.[8]

Brooker based Waldo on Ratz, a virtual floating cat head from the first series of 1990s children's show Live & Kicking. As Waldo was controlled live during filming, using state-of-the-art live animation techniques, several months of pre-production work was done at the design studio Painting Practice. Staff at Passion Pictures worked on animation, having recently developed the animated meerkat Aleksandr for the advertising campaign Compare the Meerkat.[8]

Bryn Higgins directed the episode. Describing the comedy as ""implicit"", Higgins aimed to film the episode in the style of a ""fairly slick modern thriller"". The technology shown in the episode was not too far beyond what was possible at the time, as Brooker wanted the episode to veer away from science fiction. The rig used mapped the emotions and facial movements of the performer onto the Waldo character, and it is seen in the episode. As well as Rigby, four puppeteers controlled Waldo, assigned to the roles of his eyes, his mouth, his body and the rest. Brooker requested Waldo's animation to be purposefully clunky so that the viewer would believe that Jamie was controlling him live.[8]

The Waldo van was taken to High Wycombe, a town in southeast England, where members of the public were involved in interacting with Waldo. Due to legal concerns, Waldo's penis was not shown in public. Following Liam Monroe's line ""He's making the whole system look absurd. Which it may well be, but it built these roads"", it was planned for the car to go over a pothole, but this was cut as it looked like a camera mistake.[8]

""The Waldo Moment"" is a political satire and dystopia; it features aspects of dark humour.[9][10][11] It differs from most previous episodes in its lack of science fiction elements and absence of technology as a key theme.[9][11][12] It bears similarities to the programme's first episode, ""The National Anthem"", which also has a storyline where ""the political process is subverted by the general public's insatiable appetite for stupidity and scandal"", according to Sam Parker of HuffPost.[12]

""The Waldo Moment"" explores distrust and apathy towards politicians.[9] Ryan Lambie of Den of Geek summarised the episode's message in the phrase ""self-absorption will be the death of politics"",[9] whilst Parker felt that the episode demonstrated ""a desire for a more honest form of politics"".[12] Serena Davies of The Telegraph commented that the episode was ""a mockery of the deeply compromised ideals of modern politics"", whilst reminding viewers that politicians are ""all we've got"".[13] Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy analysed that the episode criticises satire and ""those who persecute others without having anything meaningful to say"",[14] and Emily Yoshida of Grantland believed that it exposed the issues of ""cheap humour"" being leveraged by politicians.[15]

Boris Johnson, a British politician who became prime minister in 2019, was an inspiration for Waldo's character. Brooker described Johnson as ""quite a clown"", opining that his image ""inoculated him from criticism"" and set him apart from other politicians, who were seen as ""bland robots parroting the same platitudes"".[4] Three years after the episode aired, in 2016, the presidential campaign of Donald Trump began to take off. ""The Waldo Moment"" was seen as prescient with regards to Trump.[4][16][17] Several news reports, including one by Chris Cillizza, political reporter for The Washington Post, compared Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign to the episode.[18][19] Brooker also compared Trump to Waldo, describing the latter as ""an anti-politics candidate who's raucous and defensive"" and ""offers nothing"".[20][21] Brooker said that Trump and Johnson were both ""entertainers"" who ""upend normality"",[6] and successfully predicted in September 2016 that Trump would win the election.[22] On the night that Trump was elected, the Twitter account for Black Mirror posted in response: ""This isn't an episode. This isn't marketing. This is reality.""[16]

The episode has also been compared to the 2019 election of Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a satirical actor and comedian, as President of Ukraine.[23] Zelenskyy's campaign was almost exclusively restricted to the internet, with Adrian Karatnycky of Politico commenting that his campaign resembled Waldo's in that he ""made no public speeches, held no rallies and gave no press conferences"". Like Waldo, Zelenskyy had few clear policy positions prior to election.[24] The character of Waldo was also compared to ""Professor Pongoo"", a candidate in the 2012 Scottish local elections who dressed as a penguin and received more first-preference votes than the Liberal Democrats.[7][25] The technology in the episode was later compared with ""animoji""â€”avatars in the style of emoji which animate in coordination with the user's facial movements. Animoji were announced in 2017 as a new feature of the iPhone X, and resembled the technology used to animate the fictional Waldo.[17][26]

The episode aired on Channel 4 at 10 p.m. on 25 February 2013, and was watched by 1.28 million viewers, according to 7-day data from BARB.[27] In contrast to previous episodes, it drew poor critical reviews at the time of broadcast.[16] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, it holds an approval rating of 50% based on 16 reviews, with an average rating of 6.00/10. The website's critics consensus reads: ""'The Waldo Moment' aims for sharp political commentary, but comes off as uninspired as the obnoxious cartoon that runs for office.""[28] It was considered to be the weakest episode to date by Yoshida and the weakest of the series by Parker and Richard Edwards of GamesRadar+,[12][15][29] though Luke Owen of Flickering Myth found it to be the ""best and most ambitious"" of the series.[30] ""The Waldo Moment"" garnered ratings of four out of five stars in The Arts Desk,[25] 3.5 out of five stars in GamesRadar+,[29] three out of five stars in HuffPost and The Telegraph,[12][13] and a C+ rating in The A.V. Club.[31]

The characters of Jamie and Waldo received mixed reviews. David Sims of The A.V. Club criticised the ""frustratingly vague"" motivations of Jamie's character, who was ""poorly sketched out"".[31] Sims further reviewed that Waldo failed to be funny or to make meaningful comments.[31] Edwards also criticised Waldo's dialogue and called him ""too two-dimensional"".[29] He did, however, laud Waldo's virtual appearance and interactivity as a ""fantastic premise"" which was ""brilliantly executed"".[29] Lisa-Marie Ferla of The Arts Desk praised the ""perfectly-pitched comedy"" in Waldo's speech on the student-organised panel.[25]

The writing was poorly received, with Parker describing it as ""unfocused"".[12] Edwards found the storyline to be predictable and filled with tropes and Parker wrote that the characterisation in the episode was ""riddled with stereotypes"".[12][29] Owen criticised that conclusions to the relationship of Gwendolyn and Jamie were ""merely afterthoughts"".[30] Sims criticised the American think-tank meeting as ""the laziest kind of spoofery""[31] and Edwards concurred, calling it ""totally unconvincing"".[29] However, in praise of the writing, Yoshida, Ferla and Owen believed the episode's storyline to be plausible.[15][25][30]

The ending was widely criticised. Lambie described it as ""sudden"" and ""on-the-nose"",[9] Sims opined that it was ""ludicrous"",[31] and Jeffery and Davies called it ""half-baked"" and ""hammy"", respectively.[13][14] Lambie believed that the episode's message was clear halfway through;[9] contrastingly, Edwards found the message to be unclear throughout.[29] Owen found the episode to ""cram in too much story"", saying that its final quarter was paced too quickly.[30]

Various critics have authored rankings of Black Mirror episodes by quality. Lambie commented in 2017 that: ""You'll find no critical ranking of episodes the same, but they almost without exception share one thing in common: The Waldo Moment always comes in dead last.""[9] Of critics who rated the 23 instalments in the series, ""The Waldo Moment"" was ranked as follows:



Additionally, the episode was rated 21st of 22 (excluding Bandersnatch) by reviewers at IndieWire,[36] and 16th of 19 by Eric Anthony Glover of Entertainment Tonight, who ranked episodes from the first four series.[37] Proma Khosla of Mashable ranked the 22 Black Mirror instalments excluding Bandersnatch by tone, concluding that ""The Waldo Moment"" is the most pessimistic episode of the show.[38] Other critics ranked the 13 episodes in Black Mirror's first three series, where ""The Waldo Moment"" placed as follows:
